yesterday for April Fool’s my workplace had a short training article on recognizing computer-generated faces from real ones and one of the tricks mentioned was “count the teeth” and I just wanted to say that it’s both ironic and kind of horrifying how society has unwittingly cycled right back to IF YE MEET A MAN ON THE ROAD, COUNT HIS FINGERS LEST YE DEAL UNKNOWING WITH A FAE 
Furthermore, the Fae are bad at counting so you can detect their glamours by numbering their teeth.  It’s a perfectly sensible fantasy trope - and yet, I can’t recall reading any stories where that happened in fiction before, you know, it happened in real life.
