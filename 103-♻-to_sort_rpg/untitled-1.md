The Kabbalah speaks of two trees, the Tree of Life (hereby referred to as ToL) and the Tree of Death (Todd). Both of them are not actual trees, but rather sets of circles and interconnecting lines with titles that make no sense even to me as a native Hebrew speaker.

the circles in ToL are called Sephiroth. Yes, Sephiroth. That means "counts". singular is Sephira. They represent the good in humans through which Ein Sof ("the infinite", a name for God as an ever-present being) makes himself known and creates physical matter, as his grandeur is too great to do it without some kind of spiritual power tool i guess.

Todd's balls, meanwhile, are called Qliphoth. That means "shells" or "fruit peels" and i'm not making this up. Singular is Qlipha. While the Sephiroth protect the creation of physical or higher matter, the Qliphoth obscure the sheer light coming from God and where given their existence in an external matter, rather then internal (whatever that means). Therefore, the existence of Qliphoth already fills any positive purpose they might serve, living through them is bad, and man must always strive to live through the Sephiroth as a means of strengthening his will, kind of like a cosmic antivenom.

additional facts i learned while researching this:

*One of the Kabbalistic names for hell is "Tehom". That means Abyss and comes from the Babylonian Tiamat. Another name is "Tzoah Rotachat"... in modern Hebrew that means... "Boiling Feces"...

*Aleister Crowley got into Kabbalistic lore, because of course he did. He claimed that one of the demons that represent the Qliphoth is named Samael. Now, in biblical or medieval Hebrew his name would translate as "Poison Of God". In modern Hebrew, however, that means "God's Drugs" and that's really wack.

[TIL In feudal England, the legal official overseeing a shire was referred to as a reeve.

An interesting bit of history. As the King's chief representative in the shire, the Sheriff was also in charge of collecting the King's taxes. Naturally this could make Sheriffs unpopular. And because they didn't receive a salary for their job, it was expected that the Sheriff would retain a portion of the tax revenue for himself to cover his own living expenses.

King John put a stop to this. He decreed that the Sheriff was fully responsible to the Crown for all tax revenue collected in the King's name. This led to Sheriffs taking even *more* money in taxes and keeping the surplus for themselves. And again, the Sheriffs weren't paid for their work.

So what do we have? Sheriffs under an unpopular king collecting unpopular taxes and keeping more money for themselves. Sounds exactly like a situation perfect for a plucky band of outlaws to rob from the rich and give to the poor, doesn't it?

New d&d idea, civilization in underdark uses echolocation, giant dragon snoring gives them sight, can't see at "night" when it's a awake. Carry "candles" which are just screaming worms in a cage.

This post got more attention that I expected, so I'm sorry for not posting a recipe sooner. I didn't follow a specific recipe for these, but it's an easy dish to do by feel. The below measurements are estimates of what I used. Explaining the folding step is tricky in text, so I would suggest learning from a youtube video.

​

Ingredients:

- 1lb ground pork
- 1 inch piece of ginger, grated
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup mushrooms, chopped finely
- Small handful of cabbage, sliced (maybe 1 cups worth?)
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 1 tsp sake
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Dumpling wrappers (I use store-bought, they're great)
- Neutral oil (Canola, grapeseed, etc.)
- ~ 1/4 cup water

​

Steps:

1. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl.

2. Heat a pan over high heat and cook about a Tbsp worth of the filling to check for seasonings; If needed, adjust salt.

3. Take a dumpling wrapper in one hand, and spoon in a small amount to the center. Dip your finger in some water and paint the edges of the wrapper.

4. Fold the center together with a pinch, then start folding down one side creating pleats in the wrapper. Repeat down the other side. Don't worry if it is ugly, it will still be delicious. Just make sure it is sealed.

5. When you're ready to cook get a non-stick pan, with a very large surface area & a lid, over med-high heat . Pour in a liberal 2 Tbsp of the oil, I used grapeseed, anything neutral works. Once hot, place in the gyoza

6. When they are starting to get golden brown on the bottom, crank the heat to high. As quick & safe as you can be, pour in the water and immediately close the lid to steam. The amount of water really depends on your pan. You don't want to boil your gyoza, just a very small layer of water in the bottom of your pan. It should steam up quickly due to the heat.

7. Cook until the water evaporates completely. Continue frying the gyoza in the pan until they reach the crispiness you truly deserve.

8. Kill the heat, and get a plate that fits the opening of the pan. Place the plate on the top of the gyoza and flip the pan upside down to reveal the golden and crispy deliciousness underside.
