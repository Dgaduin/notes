Your DM has decided to run a short game in which all the players are mutant doppelgangers. They're born weaker than their brethren, but can consume their enemies and gain their power. Permanently.All players start off at Medium size with one 1d4 hit die, a +0 BAB, and every ability score set at 10. You are unable to speak, but you understand pantomime.However, when you deal an enemy a killing blow, you may replace one of your basic statistics with that of the killed creature -- for example, you can replace your own Ability score, Base Attack Bonus, ranks in a skill, number of hit dice, number of sides on your hit dice, Natural armor bonus, equipment proficiency, feats, class abilities, languages, or cosmetic looks to name a few. Only one characteristic can be gained from a slain creature at a time, and never more than once (such as from being Raised).Spells known and spell slots are gained on a one-for-one basis -- no, you can't steal several levels at spellcasting, though you can skip several levels if the caster is proficient enough.To use an ability you have gained by this manner, you must qualify for it -- for example, to cast a spell you have absorbed, you must still have a high enough ability score to cast it; to use Power Attack, you must have Strength 13. Etcetera.Your goal is to kill the gods.
