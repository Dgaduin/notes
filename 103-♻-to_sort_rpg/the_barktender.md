# The Barktender

#rpg #character 

Have a running joke in my campaign
There's a tavern called "The Dog?"
Complete with question mark
It looks shoddily put together but very detailed, as though it were made with a lot of love by someone with no thumbs
it's only been painted from about the waist down reliably
Inside is a relatively normal, if not shoddily detailed, tavern, complete with tables, upstairs rooms, and a bar
Behind the bar is a Shiba breed of dog with a collar
There is also a sign of terribly written out menu items that you would ask for in a tavern, such as drink, food, rooms, a bone, pets, and more
If you ask the dog for anything, he jumps up and points at the spot on the sign indicating the price
If you ask for food or drink, the dog disappears behind the counter. The SECOND you take your eyes off of the table, you hear a clatter, and turn around to see that your drink and food are there, and so is the dog, who is looking quite please with himself.
Also manages to bring your change
The dog is not magical
The dog is not unusually smart
The dog is just a regular dog
The tavern with the same exact dog somehow shows up in EVERY town with "We've just moved!" signs.
The name on the collar is Barktender
I imagine it would ruin the mystery of The Dog? a bit, as that's been one of my greater pleasures is the slight side-tracking my players do whenever they try to figure out how the fuck the dog is bringing their drinks without spillage.
