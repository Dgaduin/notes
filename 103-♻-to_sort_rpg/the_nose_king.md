Looks like the king, so it's probably him when he was younger.
The Nose King as he was commonly known, had always and forever been a kind and measured man. Ever since he was but a young prince, not yet able to lift a proper sword or ride a proper horse, the people murmured and made jest of the crooked tower that the Gods put on his face. For years, tales told by women and songs sang by men have spread across the kingdom. From the Wet Deserts to the Barren Coast, the Nose Prince was known as such. Years of being mocked by his own people have not made The Nose Prince cruel, however. Nor had it made him bitter. When he finally took seat on The Golden Throne, The Nose King changed his Royal banner to the shape his people have, over time, grown affection for and he had ruled all of his people on the Barren Coast and the Wet Desert and the people in all the lands, brooks and moors in between, with as much love as for his own nose. Always and forever.
