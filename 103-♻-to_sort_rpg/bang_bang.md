# Bang-bang

#rpg #power #pin

I always like the idea of playing a character that could immediately cause an explosion comparable to that of a hand grenade by pointing at something (or someone) with a fingergun and yelling 'bang' at the top of their lungs. The ability would function six times, but would need to be 'reloaded' afterwards by paying a large dollar amount to a deity or spirit that was trapped on the mortal coil.
	>Personally I think it would be better if he could only reload by making a "ksh" sound followed by six "click click click."
> Like a thousand bucks a 'bullet', which was a actual bullet the character would have to consume like a pill. The deity essentially bestowed the power to the character as an extortion method so it could make rent.
