Ultimate tensile strength
Let's start by making the usefulness of an alloy measurable. I'll use the unit MPa as a proxy for of puncture strength.
For the sake of comparison, here are some values:
    • human skin: 20
    • aluminium: 45
    • gold: 100
    • copper: 210
    • iron: 350
    • brass: 550
Judging by this table brass appears to be the best choice for armor and indeed it is. At least as long as you don't want to move so much. Brass has a higher density than iron (8.7 to 7.8). Also you need to keep in mind that brass is more expensive than iron. 
Precipitation hardening
Now, in order to get some decent alloys your civilization needs to know the art of precipitation hardening which ain't that hard if you use materials which have a low melting point like aluminium. 
Magnesium Alloy
If your civilization discovers magnesium (high probability as it is earths fourth most abundant resource) you have another high potential component for creating strong alloys.
If you'd put aluminium and magnesium together you can create a very strong alloy with a MPa of 450 (Aluminum alloys) and very low density, making it lightweight armor more powerful then iron. Using a lightweight material like this would allow you to construct plate-armors in which you could move around more freely or a chainmail nearly as light as a leather armor but much more pierce resistant. Using it as a weapon on the other hand has the weight disadvantage as you need some weight to cut through armor or break some bones. You should therefore not use it for a non-cutting weapon.
There are much more aluminium - alloys and magnesium alloys. Take a look yourself, but most of these alloys demand a higher level of technology. Take a look at the aluminium-zinc alloy with an MPa of 700 for example.
Cermaic Armour Plates
You could use ceramic plates in vests to get a high penetration-protective armor. Ceramic is used in a lot of modern composite armors and bullet proof vests. Ceramic armor is however a one-use armor as the ceramic tends to shatter after receiving a blow or two. As ceramic is much lighter than steel or iron, ceramic vest seems to be useful to skirmishers - fast attack, fast withdraw, minimal casualties. 
Silk Armour
This sounds ridiculous at first, but the Mongol horde used silk armors which were much more penetration-protective than European plate armor. Above the thick silk armour they've worn a scale armour to protect them from cutting damage. The silk armour was super effective as it was very light an hardly penetratable by spears and arrows alike. Silkworm silk has a density of about 1.3 and an MPa rating of 500. It's obviously not suitable as a weapon.
