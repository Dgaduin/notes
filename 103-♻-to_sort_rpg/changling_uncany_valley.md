It doesn't blink. Unless it knows it is being observed, because a very little kid once asked it why it did not blink. It had not noticed blinking before then. Now it tries to remember to blink if it thinks it is being observed but it is easy to forget if it is concentrating on something else.

Its face does not move unless the shifter moves it on purpose. Again this is something that it figured out and now incorporates into its mimicry. If it is unaware it lets that part go.

It does not breathe. Unless it needs air to talk. This one is subtle and the shifter has not figured it out yet. In between utterances it does not take another breath. If it is exercising vigorously it does not increase its respiratory rate.

All of these things lend themselves to written narrative because as opposed to a subtly different characteristic that is hard to convey with prose, these are all actions (or the lack thereof) which are much easier to convey with prose.

It could also look through people rather than at them. Never actually focusing on them, perhaps because it's eyes are not truly of human physiology and therefore function and focus differently. â€“ DKNguyen 2
