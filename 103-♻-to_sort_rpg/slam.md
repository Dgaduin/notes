# M2 Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM)

Without a doubt, the

We might be talking overall pockets here, but this is a helluva weapon, used by US Special Forces.

The two-pound mine is small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, so several can be carried. SLAM can be used in several modes: it can be set to trigger by its built-in IR motion sensor and magnetic sensor, or attached to a trip-wire, or on time delay as a demolition device. You put it in place and watch it blow.

And when it blows...this is not just a grenade, nor even a shaped charge which penetrates armor at close range. In addition to blast and shrapnel, it throws out an aerodynamic slug of metal known as an Explosively Formed Projectile or EFP. This EFP from a SLAM can punch through an inch and a half of armor from twenty-five feet away. That's enough to get through anything except a main battle tank's side armor -- and unlike a shaped charge jet from an RPG, SLAM has real 'behind-armor effects' : it will do a lot of damage to the interior of the vehicle or anyone unlucky enough to be in it. And you do not even have to be around at the time.

The SLAM can be used to "to destroy enemy vehicles, parked aircraft, ammunition sites, storage facilities and other small targets without direct contact with the enemy."

What makes it really sneaky it that SLAM can be placed on the ground and covered over to fire upwards. Plenty of tanks have thick side armor, but they tend to be very weak when attacked from underneath. Even vehicles designed to defeat blast anti-tank mines can be knocked out by an EFP.

This is going to trump any handgun ever made.

UPDATE: And that's just the version I can tell you about. There are apparently upgraded versions of SLAM with significantly enhanced capabilities. In the age of the smartphone, it's easy to see how one can have novel modes of triggering based on the sound or appearance of the target -- and the warhead may be even more dangerous than before. In the past few years there have been enhanced EFP designs that can reach out to several hundred charge diameters - suggesting a potential range of hundreds of feet for a SLAM-sized warhead.
