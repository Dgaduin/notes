# Traditional Polynesian navigation

#rpg 

Traditional Polynesian navigation was thought by some to be legend, until the maiden voyage of the Hōkūleʻa in 1975. 

This quote from the wikipedia article gets me in the feels:
professional Tongan sea captain Sione Taupeamuhu was aboard during a night passage from Tongatapu to Nomuka in the northerly Haʻapai Islands group of Tonga (map). He was skeptical that Hōkūleʻa navigator Nainoa Thompson could find Nomuka without instruments. When Nomuka appeared on the horizon at dawn as anticipated, Taupeamuhu remarked, "Now I can believe the stories of my ancestors."
