| Yield                 | Active Time | Total Time  |
| --------------------- |:----------- |:----------- |
| Makes about 25 pieces | 15 minutes  | 2 1/2 hours |

## Special Equipment

Stand mixer, half-sheet pan, pastry brush, serrated knife

## Ingredients

- 285g ounces all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 245g ounces sugar
- 2g teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
- 150g ounces whole almonds, toasted and roughly chopped
- 2 1/4 teaspoons whole anise seed, roughly chopped
- 3 large eggs (150g), straight from the fridge
- 15g ounce vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 180Â°C. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, chopped toasted almonds, and chopped anise seed. Mix on low until homogeneous, then add eggs and vanilla; continue to mix just long enough to form a soft dough.

2. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly to bring dough together into a ball, then shape into a roughly 8-inch log. Transfer dough log to a parchment-lined half-sheet pan and continue rolling the log by hand until it is approximately 16 inches long. Gently flatten dough by hand until log is about 4 inches wide and just over 1/2 inch thick (see note).

3. Bake dough until puffed and firm to the touch and just beginning to brown around the very edges (though still pale overall), about 25 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board and let cool 5 minutes more. While dough is still warm, use a long, thin, and very sharp serrated knife to cut log at a slight angle into about 25 pieces, each just over 1/2 inch wide (see note).

4. Arrange biscotti, cut sides up, on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue baking until dry to the touch and lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Flip biscotti over and continue baking for another 12 minutes. It's normal for the timing to vary according to the biscotti's size and thickness, as well as differences in oven temperature and airflow, so keep a close eye on them and adjust the bake time as needed.

5. Cool biscotti to room temperature before serving. If desired, dip in tempered chocolate. With or without chocolate, the biscotti will keep for about 3 months in an airtight container at cool room temperature.

## Make-Ahead and Storage

In an airtight container, the biscotti will keep for about 3 months at cool room temperature.

## Why It Works

Lightly chopped anise perfumes the dough, elevating the almond aroma.

Eggs alone bind and tenderize the dough, making the biscotti sturdy and lean.

Attention to detail when shaping and slicing the biscotti will ensure uniform results.

## Notes

The biscotti dough can be shaped to any length, width, and thickness, then cut to any size, but these details will affect the yield and suggested baking times of this recipe. If you're experimenting with other shapes and sizes, follow the visual and textural cues given here, rather than the specific timetables.
