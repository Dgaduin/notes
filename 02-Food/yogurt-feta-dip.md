| Yield              | Active Time | Total Time |
| ------------------ |:----------- | ---------- |
| Makes about 2 cups | 5 minutes   | 10 minutes |

## Special Equipment

* Food processor, blender, or immersion blender
* Fine-mesh strainer (optional)

## Ingredients

* 225g feta cheese
* 170g Greek yogurt
* 1 medium clove garlic, minced
* 15ml extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper (optional)

## Directions

1. In a food processor bowl or blender jar, or using a tall and narrow vessel suitable for an immersion blender, combine feta, yogurt, and garlic, then blend or process until very smooth, scraping down sides as necessary. Add olive oil and blend until incorporated.
2. If desired, pass spread through a fine-mesh strainer for an even silkier texture.
3. Season with salt, if needed, and pepper, if using, then use as desired.

## Make-Ahead and Storage

The dip can be made up to 5 days in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container. It will thicken up after refrigeration; whip in additional Greek yogurt to loosen if necessary.

## Ideas

Dill, mint, or oregano can be added during or after blending.
