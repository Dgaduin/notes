These cute no-bake chocolate and Nutella cheesecakes are a chocoholic's dream come true. An intense dark chocolate filling is spooned on top of a crumbly Oreo crust and topped with a creamy, rich Nutella filling. They don't really look like a traditional cheesecake, but does that matter?

Why this recipe works:

By adding just a few teaspoons of cocoa powder to the chocolate filling, the chocolate flavor deepens dramatically.

Passing the filling through a fine-meshed sieve gets rid of even the tiniest lumps.

Note: This recipes makes 4 to 6 individual no-bake cheesecakes, depending on the size of your serving cups.

Ingredients

For the Crust:

8 Oreo cookies
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

For the Nutella Filling:

1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons heavy cream
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
5 ounces cream cheese, softened at room temperature
1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons (4 ounces) Nutella

For the Chocolate Filling:

3 ounces semisweet chocolate
1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons heavy cream
4 teaspoons granulated sugar
5 ounces cream cheese, softened at room temperature
5 teaspoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder

For Serving:

Whipped cream

Crushed toasted hazelnuts

Crushed Oreos

Directions

1.

For the Crust: In a food processor, pulse Oreos until finely ground. Add melted butter and pulse for another few seconds until evenly coated. Alternatively, put the cookies in a zipper-lock bag and crush with a rolling pin before adding the melted butter. Spoon Oreo mixture into 4 to 6 serving glasses in an even layer. Set aside.

2.

For the Nutella Filling: In a small bowl, whip cream with sugar until it holds soft peaks. Set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl and using an electric hand mixer, whip cream cheese until smooth and fluffy. Add Nutella and whip until smooth, about 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in whipped cream until no streaks remain.

3.

For the Chocolate Filling: Melt chocolate in the bowl of a double boiler or in the microwave. Set aside to cool slightly.

4.

In a small bowl, whip cream with sugar until it holds soft peaks. Set aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl and using an electric hand mixer, whip cream cheese until smooth and fluffy. Add cooled chocolate and cocoa powder and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Mix in two thirds of the whipped cream. If the mixture looks lumpy after 3 minutes of mixing, pass through a fine-meshed sieve. Fold in the remaining whipped cream with a rubber spatula.

5.

For Serving: Spoon or pipe filling into serving cups, starting with layers of Chocolate Filling followed by Nutella Filling. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Garnish with whipped cream, crushed Oreoâ€™s or toasted hazelnuts before serving.
