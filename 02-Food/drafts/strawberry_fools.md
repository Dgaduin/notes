The classic British fool, a dessert of fruit and whipped cream, is an ideal warm weather dessert because it's light and balance of sweet and tart fruit flavors. Juicy macerated strawberries, strawberry compote, and tangy yogurt are spooned into this refreshing, light version.

Why this recipe works:

Cooking some of the berries eliminates extra liquid and keeps the fool from being too soggy.

Macerating fresh strawberries concentrates their flavor while adding a fresh counterpoint to the cooked berries.

Tangy and thick Greek-style yogurt adds flavor and body to the whipped cream.

Notes: Instead of portioning into individual glasses, you can also serve the fool family-style in a large bowl or trifle dish.

Ingredients

24 ounces fresh strawberries, washed, hulled, and chopped
6 tablespoons sugar, divided, plus more to taste
2 teaspoons fresh juice from 1 lemon
1 cup chilled heavy cream
1/4 cup Greek-style yogurt
1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions

1.

Place half of the strawberries and 3 tablespoons sugar in small saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until berries have softened and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice; add sugar to taste. Chill completely before using, about 1 hour.

2.

Meanwhile, stir together remaining strawberries and 3 tablespoons sugar in a medium bowl. Chill, stirring occasionally, until berries have released some of their juice, about 30 minutes.

3.

Whip cream to soft peaks. Gently fold in yogurt and vanilla until combined. Reserve 1/4 cup whipped cream for garnish. Fold chilled strawberry compote into whipped cream.

4.

Spoon strawberry cream into glasses alternating with macerated strawberries. Top each with 1 tablespoon of the reserved whipped cream. Serve chilled.
