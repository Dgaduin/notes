5 PRINTER-FRIENDLY VERSION

These little pancakes, a variant of matzo brei, are sometimes known as chremslach or bubeleh. No matter the name, they're delicious: golden and tender, with a delicate crunch of granulated sugar sprinkled on top.

These matzo pancakes are quicker and easier to toss together than even the simplest American-pancake recipe (short of a store-bought mix, anyway). Simply crush and wet the matzo, drain it, then mix with beaten eggs and cook. It's a popular item on Ashkenazi Jewish tables, especially when sprinkled with sugar, and way better than its meager ingredient list could ever possibly suggest.

Why It Works

Breaking up sheets of matzo allows you to control the size of the particles and therefore the final pancake texture.

Soaking the matzo in water softens it, allowing it to form a rough batter when mixed with the eggs.

Ingredients

4 sheets matzo (about 1 1/2 ounces; 40g each)
4 large eggs

Kosher salt

Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan

Granulated sugar, for serving

Directions

1.

In a medium mixing bowl, crush matzo sheets into small pieces. (Exactly how small is a question of personal preference; you can reduce it all to a rough meal, or leave some larger chunks for a more varied texture.)

2.

Add just enough cold water to saturate all the crushed matzo and let stand until softened, about 1 minute. Drain matzo, pressing out excess water, and return to the bowl.

3.

In a small mixing bowl, beat eggs with a large pinch of salt. Add eggs to matzo and mix well.

4.

In a large nonstick or cast iron skillet, melt 1 tablespoon (15g) butter over medium heat until foaming. Using a soup spoon, dollop matzo batter into pan, forming small oval pancakes. Cook until golden on the first side, about 2 minutes. Turn pancakes and continue cooking until golden on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Continue with remaining matzo batter, using additional butter as needed to keep the pan greased; adjust heat throughout to maintain a gentle but active sizzle.

5.

Transfer matzo pancakes to a platter and keep warm. Serve with a dish of granulated sugar on the side, for sprinkling on top at the table.
