Chocolaty chunks of crunchy Oreo bits turn these soft and chewy vanilla cookies into a fresh-baked version of cookies 'n' cream. Feel free to grab a package of Oreos, or have fun with a homemade batch if you prefer—both will deliver the crunch and big cocoa flavor these cookies need.

Why It Works

Blending butter with coconut oil creates a cookie that's rich, chewy, and mild—the perfect canvas for crunchy Oreo cookie bits.

Frozen Oreos hold up better in the oven, retaining their texture and shape.

Rolling the dough smooth and flattening each portion helps the cookies spread more evenly.

Ingredients

4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g), pliable but cool (about 60°F; 16°C)
3 1/2 ounces refined or virgin coconut oil (about 1/2 cup; 100g), solid but creamy (about 70°F; 21°C); see note
10 1/2 ounces sugar (about 1 1/2 cups; 295g)
1 1/4 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 15g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge
10 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal (about 2 1/3 cups, spooned; 295g)
8 ounces Oreos, store-bought or homemade (about 20 sandwich cookies; 225g), chopped and frozen until cold

Directions

1.

Make the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Combine butter, coconut oil, sugar, salt, baking powder, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, pausing to scrape bowl with a flexible spatula halfway through. With mixer running, add egg and continue beating until smooth. Reduce speed to low, add flour, and mix to form a stiff dough, then add frozen cookie pieces and continue mixing until well combined.

2.

Portion the Dough: With a scoop, divide dough into 2-tablespoon portions. With your hands, roll each piece smooth and round. (If you like, portioned dough can be refrigerated in a heavy-duty zipper-lock bag up to 1 week, or frozen 6 months. Stand at room temperature until quite soft, about 70°F/21°C, and proceed as directed.)

3.

Bake the Dough: Arrange portions on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, leaving 2 inches between cookies to account for spread. With the palm of your hand, flatten each into a 1/2-inch disk; if you like, garnish with extra Oreo crumbs. Bake until puffed and firm around the edges, and pale overall but with a hint of browning around the very edges, about 12 minutes. Cool directly on baking sheet until crumb is set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container up to 3 days at room temperature.

Notes

Surprisingly, virgin coconut oil works well in this recipe, giving the cookies a wonderful aroma that's not overtly coconutty at all, but refined coconut oil is clearly the most neutral option. Feel free to use whichever you have on hand.
