Ingredients

1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 cups ice cold water
1 package instant vanilla pudding mix
3 cups heavy cream
1 12-ounce box Nabisco Nilla Wafers
5 cups sliced bananas, from 5 to 6 bananas, sliced

Directions

1.

In a medium bowl, beat together sweetened condensed milk and water with a whisk until well combined, about 1 minute. Add the pudding mix and beat until mixture thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Cover pudding and let it set in refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.

2.

In a large bowl, whip heavy cream with a whisk until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Fold in pudding mixture.

3.

In a large bowl (or individual parfait glasses) assemble the pudding. First, lay one third of Nilla Wafers across bottom of the bowl. Top with one third of the banana slices. Cover with one third of the pudding mixture. Continue with two more layers, reserving a few Nilla wafers to lay across the top as garnish.

4.

Let pudding set in refrigerator for at least two hours before serving. Can be made the day ahead.
