Simplicity rules in this slaw, where equal amounts of cider vinegar and sugar create a straightforward sweet-and-tangy flavor that's incredibly versatile, not to mention delicious.

Why this recipe works:

A sugar-and-salt mixture purges the cabbage of excess moisture, leaving it tender, but still crunchy and well seasoned.

An equal amount of vinegar and sugar gives this slaw a tangy and sweet character.

Celery seeds add a light celery flavor and some pleasing texture.

Ingredients

For the Dressing:

1 cup apple cider vinegar
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon finely minced garlic (about 1 medium clove)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon celery seeds
 

For the Slaw:

1 large head green cabbage (about 3 1/2 pounds), finely shredded on a mandoline or by hand
1 large carrot, peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater
1 medium yellow onion, finely sliced on a mandoline or by hand
2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup kosher salt

Directions

1.

For the Dressing: Whisk together vinegar, sugar, oil, garlic, black pepper, and celery seeds in small bowl.

2.

For the Slaw: Combine cabbage, carrot, and onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with sugar and salt and toss to combine. Let stand five minutes, then transfer to a large colander and rinse thoroughly under cold running water.

3.

Transfer vegetables to a salad spinner and spin dry. Alternatively, transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet lined with a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel and blot mixture dry with more towels. Return to large bowl.

Pour dressing over vegetables and toss to coat. Adjust seasoning to taste with salt, pepper, and/or sugar.
