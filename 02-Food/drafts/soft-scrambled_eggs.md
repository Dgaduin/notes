Ingredients

3 large eggs, beaten
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons (30ml) milk (optional; see note)
1/2 tablespoon (7g) unsalted butter

Freshly ground black or white pepper

Directions

1.

In a small bowl, beat eggs with salt and milk (if using) until no visible egg whites remain. In a small nonstick skillet, combine beaten eggs with butter. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring with a silicone spatula, until eggs are moist and just beginning to set. Remove from heat and continue to cook, stirring, until eggs have just set into soft curds; return to heat briefly if needed to cook slightly more. Season with pepper and serve right away.

Special Equipment

Notes

Milk will make slightly richer, moister eggs, but is not required.
