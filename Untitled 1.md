It is such a smooth game. It gets us roleplaying in no time and everyone gets to participate in all the scenes. And more importantly, it is a breeze to facilitate! I think I have been playing it too much though as it is starting to feel samey to me. I need to make other scenarios for it. Want to try something with that setting you posted recently in a small village where a wedding is about to take place and the pig got stolen, and another one where the action takes place following the wake of a wealthy person as the now adult children get to deal with family secrets exposed as they clean their old family house.
