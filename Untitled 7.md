Designing a custom focus state
So what would we need to do to have a focus state that people can see? The main guidelines I use are:

If you're relying on color to signify a change in state, the color contrast ratio between the default color and the focus color needs to be at least 3:12.
Make sure that any outlines are thick enough to actually see. There aren't any official guidelines on this, but at least use something larger than 1px.
