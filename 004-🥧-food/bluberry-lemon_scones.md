Blueberry-Lemon Scones Recipe
Despite containing both coconut oil and coconut milk, these scones don't end up with a coconutty flavor at all. Rather, these ingredients provide the same richness and tender but fluffy crumb you'd find in traditional scones made with butter and cream. Their flavor is light and lemony, with bursts of juicy blueberry under a crunchy crust of toasted sugar. Do be sure to refrigerate the dough, which mixes up a little warmer and softer than a typical scone dough made with chilled dairy ingredients. But don't worry—that step takes only 15 minutes, which is about how long it takes to preheat an oven.

Why It Works
A blend of coconut oil and full-fat coconut milk provides just the right sense of richness in the scones, along with enough water to help them rise nice and light.
Lemon zest rounds out the aroma of the scones, highlighting the fresh blueberries.
Look for small blueberries with tight skins, which offer a more concentrated flavor.
Refrigeration ensures that these scones won't spread too thin.
A sprinkling of toasted or turbinado sugar, while optional, adds a layer of crunchy sweetness and complexity.
YIELD:
Makes six 4-inch scones
ACTIVE TIME:
5 minutes
TOTAL TIME:
45 minutes
Ingredients
9 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g), plus more for dusting
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
2 ounces refined coconut oil (about 1/4 cup; 55g), solid but creamy (see note)
6 ounces fresh blueberries (1 cup; 170g)
1/4 ounce lemon zest (about 1 tablespoon; 7g)
8 ounces unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk (1 cup; 225g), shaken or stirred until homogeneous before measuring (see note)
Toasted or turbinado sugar, to taste (optional)
Directions
1.
For the Dough: Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and coconut oil in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until oil disappears into a powdery meal. Transfer to a medium bowl, then toss with blueberries and lemon zest. Stir in coconut milk with a flexible spatula to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, pat into a 7-inch round, and refrigerate 15 minutes. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).

2.
To Bake: Using a chef’s knife, cut chilled wheel of dough into 6 wedges. Sprinkle generously with toasted or turbinado sugar, if using, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan. Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes, and serve warm.

Special Equipment
Food processor, parchment paper, half sheet pan
Notes
To keep the flavor of the scones neutral, reach for refined coconut oil; if you'd prefer a slightly tropical aroma, try virgin coconut oil instead. In either case, it's important to use cans of unsweetened, full-fat coconut milk, not the stuff that's watered down and sold in refrigerated cartons.
