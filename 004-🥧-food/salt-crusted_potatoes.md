Simmering potatoes in heavily salted water until the water runs completely dry gives them a crystallized salt crust. This is the potato recipe for the salt-lover.

Why this recipe works:

Simmering in heavily salted water dries out the exteriors of the potatoes and thins the skins.
As the liquid evaporates, it leaves behind a crunchy, salty crust on the potatoes.
