Grill-Roasted Carrots With Sweet Soy Glaze Recipe

These carrots develop a natural sweetness as they're roasted on the grill. A finishing brush with a honey and soy sauce mixture leaves them with a glistening glaze that has a salty depth and a mild ginger and garlic bite.

Why this recipe works:

Cutting the carrots on the bias makes each slice larger and less likely to fall between the grates.
Roasting the carrots over indirect heat for 45 to 60 minutes renders them tender throughout and caramelized around the edges
Brushing the carrots with a honey and soy sauce mixture in the last minutes of cooking creates a glaze that enhances the sweetness and provides a salty contrast.

Ingredients
For the Glaze:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon freshly minced garlic, about 1 medium clove
1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
For the Carrots:
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch slices on a bias
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 scallion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt
Type of fire: two-zone indirect
Grill heat: medium-high

Directions
1.
For the Glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper. Set aside.


2.
For the Carrots: Toss carrot slices with oil in a medium bowl. Season lightly with salt.


3.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place carrot slices on cool side of grill, close to, but not directly over, the coals. Cover and cook until tender all the way through, about 45 minutes, flipping carrots every 15 minutes for even browning.


4.
Brush carrots all over with glaze, cover grill, and continue to cook for 3 minutes longer.


5.
Transfer carrots to serving bowl, drizzle with additional glaze, garnish with scallion, and serve immediately.
