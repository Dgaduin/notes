Avocado Toast With Cucumber, Soy Sauce, and Shichimi Togarashi Recipe
Seedless cucumber does a great job adding cooling crunch to avocado toast, but it doesn't impart much in the way of flavor. Here, soy sauce adds a savory note, amped up by a sprinkle of peppery scallions. But the real kicker is a pinch of shichimi (also commonly called togarashi), a Japanese seven-spice blend of chili peppers, sesame seeds, and other ingredients like nori, ginger, and orange peel, which adds nuanced heat to each bite.

1 slice country or sandwich bread, approximately 1/2 inch thick
Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 medium pitted and peeled Hass avocado
1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce, plus more to taste
4 to 5 thin slices seedless cucumber, or enough to cover surface of bread
Thinly sliced scallion, to garnish
Shichimi togarashi, to taste (see note)

Lightly brush bread with olive oil and toast to desired level of doneness. Meanwhile, mash avocado and soy sauce in a bowl. Top toast with avocado mixture and top with cucumber slices and scallion. Sprinkle with shichimi togarashi to taste and serve.

Notes
The volume of each ingredient will depend on the size of your bread and personal preference. Apply to taste. You can order shichimi online, find it in most Asian specialty stores, or simply substitute some ground red chili pepper, black pepper, powdered ginger, and sesame seeds for a comparable, if somewhat less nuanced, seasoning.
