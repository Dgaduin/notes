This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever published. No big secret techniques, no strange ingredients, in fact, without counting salt and pepper, you only need seven extra things from the supermarket aside from the buttermilk you probably already have in your fridge and been wondering how to use up.

Why It Works
Tossing the shredded vegetables with a pinch of salt before you form the dressing helps them break down just enough to soften while retaining plenty of fresh crunch.
A combination of buttermilk and mayonnaise gives the dressing fresh buttermilk tang, but enough thickness to coat the vegetables.

1 medium carrot, grated on the large holes of a box grater (about 3/4 cup)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar

Notes
I like to use a mix of red and green cabbage, though either on its own is fine. This coleslaw will keep in the refrigerator for up to five days.
