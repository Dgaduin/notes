One of our favorite summertime tricks is to make a batch of whipped Greek yogurt, which is exactly what it sounds like—a cross between airy whipped cream and dense yogurt. We love it with the caramel notes of golden syrup, but it works with honey, maple syrup, or molasses as well. Chill and serve with fresh fruit as a parfait, or use as a topping for pound cake, pie, or French toast.

Why It Works
True Greek yogurt is strained, making a thick, low-moisture foundation for this dessert.
A small proportion of cream thickens and aerates the yogurt.
Ingredients like golden syrup and honey add both flavor and sweetness to the dessert.

Ingredients
8 ounces plain Greek yogurt (about 1 cup; 225g), any percentage will do (see note)
6 ounces heavy cream (about 3/4 cup; 170g)
2 ounces golden syrup, sorghum syrup, honey, or maple syrup (about 3 tablespoons; 55g)
1/4 teaspoon rosewater or vanilla extract, or seeds from 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
Pinch of salt

Directions
1.
Combine Greek yogurt, cream, sweetener, rosewater or vanilla, and a pinch of salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix at low speed to start, then increase to high and whip until mixture is thick and stiff, about 5 minutes. Use immediately as a soft, whipped cream–like topping, or, to serve as a parfait, divide into serving dishes and refrigerate until thickened (roughly to 45°F/7°C).

Notes
Avoid Greek yogurt thickened with gum, gelatin, or pectin. Look for brands that contain only milk and active cultures, like Fage. Unstrained yogurts, whether faux Greek or plain, will not whip as light or thick.
