Crisp, tender, and complex, this grilled spiced cauliflower takes a fall staple and pushes it to the extremes of both flavor and texture.

Why this recipe works:

A spice mixture gives the cauliflower an earthy flavor with just a touch of heat.
Grilling the cauliflower over direct heat first creates a lightly charred, crispy crust.
Finishing the cauliflower over indirect heat lets it gently cook until tender throughout.
Note: When slicing the cauliflower, be sure to cut through it vertically so that the florets on each slice are held together by a portion of the core and/or stalkâ€”you want large pieces of cauliflower so that they don't slip down through the grill grate.
