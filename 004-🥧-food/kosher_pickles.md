Start by trimming the ends of your cucumbers. Tare a scale with a container large enough to fit your cucumbers. Add your cucumbers and cover with water. Calculate 3% of the weight of the water plus cucumbers, and add that much salt (round down a little). Add 1/4 teaspoon calcium chloride per quart of water if you want crisper pickles. Add aromatics as desired, such as bay leaves, fresh dill, black peppercorns, and garlic. Place in a fermentation container and ensure that the cucumbers are completely submerged. Ferment at room temperature for a week or two until desired sourness is achieved. Store in the fridge after that.
