Why It Works
Combining coffee and hot chocolate = maximum fun.
Whisking the mixture makes it extra frothy.

2/3 cup (160ml) strong coffee or espresso
Whipped cream, for serving

Notes
Different types of cocoa powder will yield slightly different results, with natural cocoa powder creating a more acidic, fruity flavor, while Dutch-processed cocoa will be earthier and nuttier. In this application, Dutch would be my recommendation, since the coffee generally brings its own acidity. Also, take note of the cocoa's fat contentâ€”supermarket brands like Hershey's are inexpensive because they're partially defatted, while powders like Valrhona or Cacao Barry Extra Brute have nearly twice the fat, helping to improve the mouthfeel in a light-bodied drink like this one.
