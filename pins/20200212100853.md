Not everything has to be directly driven by adaptation.

Consider everyone's favourite mammal, the Naked mole-rat. They live in low oxygen, high carbon dioxide tunnels and have to deal with inconveniences like occasionally tunneling through a nest of angry ants. Result? they're extremely pain insensitive, can not only tolerate atmospheres that would kill other animals but survive there for quite a surprising length of time.

Moreover, they have a fascinating resistance to cancer, which isn't entirely understood as yet. They seem to do better at producing error-free proteins, and their cells are less prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Their ability to lower their own metabolic rates during lean times reduces oxidative damage caused by metabolism. These things all help to combine to drive a surprisingly long lifespan for such a small creature... perhaps 30 years, simply because they're resistant to a bunch of common ways for other animals to die as they age.

Now, I'm not necessarily suggesting that you make your elves like naked mole rats, because although that would be awesome and definitely buck the trend of stereotypical tolkienesque elvishness it is perhaps a bit of a long way from anything that might be called elfin (though, do contrast with the Falmer of the Elder Scrolls).

Nonetheless it does show how interesting environmental adaptations can lead to knock-on effects that are useful in themselves.
