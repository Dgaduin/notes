## PERT Estimates

PERT estimates involve providing three main values:

- Pessimistic Estimate – when everything goes wrong
- Optimistic Estimate – when everything goes to plan
- Most Likely Estimate – when some things go right and some things go wrong (normal case)

The resulting estimate is then calculated from the following formula:

> Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6

This is also called a weighted average. You can also calculate the volatility of the estimate in the following way:

> (O – P) / 6

If the result is small then your estimate is more confident than if the number is high.

All this gives you a lot more data than a single story point will, IMHO and is my preferred way to breaking down items to provide an estimate.
