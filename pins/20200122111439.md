Summary

This is an HTML hack to make pages more friendly to those with JavaScript disabled or with no JavaScript support.


This HTML hack allows users with JavaScript disabled or without JavaScript support to still view web content, just without the convenience of JavaScript. Add this tag to the HTML head (best after the <meta charset="utf-8" /> tag) and it will create an automatic redirect to the no-JS-friendly site.

Core code.

<noscript><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=www.example.com/no-js-version" /></noscript>
