Refit is a library that allows for generating API clients based on an interface definition, using the builtin `HttpClient` under the hood. The clients get generated at compile time.

It's quite easy to create a full `HttpClient` middleware pipeline and add it to [[aspcore_framework|ASP Core]] DI system.
