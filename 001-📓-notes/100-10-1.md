# 100-10-1

#work/productivity

How I changed my approach: Shortly there after I started applying a creative writing technique called 100:10:1 to evaluating and rescuing software systems. The idea behind 100:10:1 is simple:

    Brainstorm 100 things that could go wrong
    Pick 10 on that list that feel like the most likely and investigate them
    Find the 1 critical problem youâ€™re going to focus on.
