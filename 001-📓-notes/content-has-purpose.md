# Content has purpose, around which design has to happen
#design 

Things have names, and need to be verbed. Defining the names and the verbs is the most important part of UX.
When you fail to grapple directly with the [[nobody-reads|actual content]], but focus on designing boxes for whatever the content will be, what you’re actually doing is putting [[colour-is-meaningless|pretty boxes]] between the user and their goals. Design the content, and you’ll probably be just about done.
