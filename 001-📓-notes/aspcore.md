#aspcore #csharp 

ASP.Net Core is a redo of the old MVC framework for the new .Net Core standard. It includes a lot if improvements and way leaner architecture. Some interesting points are a built-in DI system, a middleware approach to requests, agnostic controllers in regards to Razer and WebAPI.

It also comes with a great support for [[efcore|EF Core]] out of the box, which is probably one of the most feature-full ORMs available for .Net.
