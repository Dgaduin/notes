# UK Mission Command	
#leadership #management

In the UK army command is executed in 4 simple steps:
1. State what you, as the leader, are trying to achieve, and why ('the big picture')
2. State what you want the subordinate to achieve
3. Define the resources available to the subordinate, and any constraints
4. Say how you want progress / issues to be reported

You don’t define how the subordinate should carry out the task – if they are competent and you trust them, they should be able to figure this out themselves.
