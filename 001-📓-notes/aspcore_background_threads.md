# ASP background threads crash
#tech/language/dotnet 

Asp under IIS blows if you start a thread under application_start event because it's missing a context and throws an exception.

Also since you can't unload DLLs one by one, when unloading or loading the app you risk the thread not to be shutdown as expected.

A potential work around is to use [[../102-âœ’-drafts/csharp_thread-pool_queue-user-work-item|ThredPool.QueueUserWorkItem]]
