We can validate controller DI dependecies in asp core by adding 
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers()
        .AddControllersAsServices(); // Add the controllers to DI

    // services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();
    services.AddSingleton<DataService>();
}
```

By default this only runs on dev build, if we want to use it in general we can use

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            })
            // Add a new service provider configuration
            .UseDefaultServiceProvider((context, options) =>
            {
                options.ValidateScopes = context.HostingEnvironment.IsDevelopment();
                options.ValidateOnBuild = true;
            });
```
