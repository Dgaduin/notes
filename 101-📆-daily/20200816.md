The author fails to mention the only truly-abusive us of this: working around readonly variables:
  struct Location {
    public readonly float x;
    public readonly float y;
    public Location(float ax, float ay) {
      x = ax;
      y = ay;
    }
    public float X { 
      get { return x; }
      set { this = new Location(value, y); }
    }
  }
