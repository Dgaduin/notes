Null process = no formalised process 
Leads to blackboxing of decsisions and unspoken expectations. This can create barriers to entry or progress and expensive onboarding/handof
This also leads to un-addresable bias in a process in situations as hiring, promoting and making fair decisions.

This can be addressed by light-weight processes like checklists and automation 

in addition the process should be open for evolution and iteration. Allow the process to rise from the actual users of the process and don't force it downwards
