# dotNet Arrays

`Array.Clear()` becomes faster than `for(;;)` iteration @~ 100 elements

`Array.Copy()` to quickly reallocate arrays.

`Buffer.BlockCopy(t, 0, x, 0, 30 * sizeof(int))` - can be used to remap datatypes, very quickly, including between different multi dimensional arrays

Setting initial capacity reduces reallocation due to backing store volume increase `List` `HahSet` `Dictionary` - it starts at `0,4` and doubling at each step after
