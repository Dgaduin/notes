# Untitled 1

My approach has always been improving in these areas: technique, theory, vocabulary and maybe the most important, hearing.

This was my roadmap:

**Technique:**

Practice all of this with a metronome, and practice it slowly. Start by playing quarter notes (one note per beat) with metronome set to 70 bpm and work your way up.

1. Learn major scale in all 12 keys in all 5 positionsstart with C major and practice it in all 5 positions, when you are comfortable with it practice it in other key, for example G major. Then D major and so on.
2. Learn the pentatonic scale in all 12 keys in all positions(minor blues pentatonic)
3. Learn natural and harmonic minor scale in all 12 keys in all 5 positionsstart with A minor, go to E minor etc.
4. Learn what chords fit in each scalefor example:in C major you can use these chords: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B diminishedin G major you can use these chords: G major, A minor, B minor, C major, D major, E minor, F# diminishedYou will start to see this pattern in other major scalesDo the same with natural and haromnic minor.
5. Download some technique building exercise book, my personal favourites are:
6. Chop Builder - Frank Gambale (the whole video is on youtube, but you should find PDF with tabs easily online) - learn the exercise and play along the video ( you don't have to learn all the exercises, just enough to do 30 min warmup before a practice session)
7. Rock Discipline - John Petrucci
8. Practice arpeggios in all position. For example practice C major or A minor chord arpeggio all over the neck. When you are comfortable with these arpeggios go to other chords like G major or E minor etc. Google for more tabs of the arpeggios and more info.

**This is an example of my practice session:**

Times displayed are arbitrary ( if you practice 4-5 hours a day this is what I would recommend, if you don't have that much time, shorten your warmup)

Warmup (should be 1/4 of your practice session):

1. 20-30 min Frank Gambale chop builder exercises  
    
2. 20 -30 min C major scale with metronome on 70 bpm (cca 5 min on each scale position)
3. 20-30 min A natural minor scale with metronome on 70 bpm (cca 5 min on each scale position)
4. Try to create or improvise some melodies on different scale positions
5. 20-30 min C major arpeggio
6. 20-30 min A minor arpeggio

Main part (3/4 of your practice session):  

3-4 hours of learning new songs and solos, ear training exercises, improvisation and jamming.

**Theory:**

Figure out chords to songs and analyse them. Figure out in which key they are in, and how those chords fit together. Also figure out what scale to solo in over a particular chord progression. Don't try to figure out to complicated songs at first. Best genre to start with is pop or something similar because they usually stay within a scale (Good songs with easy progressions to learn: No woman no cry, Let it be, Knocking on heavens door, Valerie, Wonderwall, Can't Stop rhcp, All along the watchtower, etc) . Once you have a good understanding of diatonic (within the key) harmony you should focus on 7th and 9th chords,secodary dominants, modes (dorian, mixolydian, etc) and modulations.You should also work on most common chord progressions and cliches like:

- 1 5 6 4 chord progression ( in C major that means C G Am F, in G major that means G D Em C). You should be able to recognise this progression in any key
- 1 4 5 chord progression (in C major: C F G)
- 2 5 1 chord progression (in C major: Dm G C)
- 1 6 2 5 chord progression (in C major: C Am Dm G)
- Line chiche (something like While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Stairway to Heaven intro progressions)
- Blues progression
- Minor blues progression
- Extended blues progression (Turn me on - Norah Jones, I'm Gonna Find Another You - John Mayer)
- 2 5 vamps (in C major - Dm G7) (Uptown Funk - Bruno Mars, Red Baron - Billy Cobham) - usually used in funk

**Vocabulary:**

Learn songs and solos, preferably by ear. That's it. Good starting solos are Let it Be, Little Wing, Knocking on Heavens Door, Hey Joe, Cream - White Room.You should learn something new all the time and practice it. Don't do just scale exercises, that will get you no where without vocabulary.

Another good exercise is learning fragments of songs by ear. For example when you are listening to a song just pickup your guitar and try to figure out a vocal melody or some riff or bass line or really anything you can pick up by ear. It will get better over time.

**Hearing:** This depends on your natural hearing ability. Your goal should be to be able to learn literally anything by ear, chords, solos, melodies. It is a long process but with practice you will see improvement.Start with practicing recognising intervals (there are a lot of ear training apps)Then try singing those intervals all the time when you hear them.Sing everything you hear. Melodies and solos especially. Try to always be pitch perfect (it maybe hard at first, but after some time (it could take a few months or years) you will be much better). I cannot stress this enough: SINGING IS REALLY IMPORTANT! Even though you may not want to be a singer it is really important to sing when in practice room because it will develop your ear and pitch.Singing exercise: play a C major chord on guitar and then sing all the notes of the C major arpeggion (C E G). Listen how each note has different meaning in context of a chord.Also figure out chord progressions by ear. Learn how four chord sounds like in context of a major scale ( example: how F major chord sounds like in context of C major scale).

Apps that helped me alot where: Functional Ear Training (I think it's android only), Perfect Ear Trainer, and Ultimate Ear Trainig (a bit hard for a begginer, but the most complete one).
