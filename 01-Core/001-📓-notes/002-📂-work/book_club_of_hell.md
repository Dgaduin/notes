# Book Club of Hell

#work/productivity

> AWS purportedly puts design documents forward in the form of six-pagers. They start meetings with a 20 minute silent reading session. It's like the book club from hell.

This approach can be leveraged against meetings where you get lectured at via presentation or there is a document sent ahead of time which people only claim to read, both of which lead to wasted time.

This approach to meetings provides a no distraction environment to read the document, mark it up and be prepared to discuss it in proper depth.

Typical layout of the document:

- 1 page of press release and FAQ
- 2 pages of architecture overview
- 2 pages of business justification
- 1-2 pages of appendix
