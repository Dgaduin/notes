# Allow Everyone to Lead

#work/leadership

## One Project - One Engineering Lead

Giving leaders an identity makes ownership obvious. This also provides autonomy on the how and why, and instills responsibility in the owner.

## Team Lead Expectations

Setting up outcomes/expectations removes micro-management and allows flexibility in achieving the results, similar to the [[command-vs-control|distinction between command and controll in military units]].

## Regular, Written Updates

The update would summarise progress towards the next milestone, how this process changed from last time, and progress the previous week. Risks and delays would explicitly be called out, along with plans to mitigate. This update would be emailed to key stakeholders and all of the team members, including project managers. This can help engineering leads better understand stakeholders and their requirements.
