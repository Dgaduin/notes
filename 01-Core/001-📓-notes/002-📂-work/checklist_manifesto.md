# Highlights From The Checklist Manifesto

#work/productivity

- Checklist should short and to the point, they are there to supposed an already capable individual and their skills. There is no expectation that the checklist will cover every single detail, but to remind the individual of mundane steps that might be missed.
- Checklists provide most of the benefits when they are created from the people who are executing them - having the checklist fed top-to-bottom usually comes with bad assumptions about people's knowledge and capacity, and tend to be overly long and detailed. This is a similar approach taken by [[self_organising_teams|self-organising teams]] in software development.
- Checklists need to have an obvious point in which they are to be used - the beginning of a process, a specific failure ([[runbook|Runbooks]] are a type of checklist), or at the end.
- DO-CONFIRM checklist work as a confirmation point for an already executed process, while READ-DO checklist guide through a process.Â 
- 5-9 items is the optional amount of items in a list(due to general memory capacity), but this is just a guideline. Keeping the execution to less than 2 minutes can help prevent people from skipping steps and taking shortcuts.
