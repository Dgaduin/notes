# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

## Review

  

Great book that still has relevant insights, despite being nearly 50 years old. The only drawback would be the meandering (more than usual) part 3, but the book quickly catches up on itself and manages to deliver an impactful ending and an even more impacting afterword

## Notes

- ‘That’s the first normal thing I’ve said in weeks. The rest of the time I’m feigning twentieth-century lunacy just like you are. So as not to draw attention to myself.

- ‘I was just going to say you sure don’t talk like anyone else.’ ‘Yes, Chris, I know that,’ I say. ‘It’s a problem.

- Thoreau’s Walden

- I read a sentence or two, wait for him to come up with his usual barrage of questions, answer them, then read another sentence or two. Classics read well this way. They must be written this way.

- They’re going to show off that truck and their tractor and that new washing machine and they’ll have the tools to fix them if they go wrong, and know how to use the tools. They value technology. And they’re the ones who need it the least. If all technology stopped, tomorrow, these people would know how to make out. It would be rough, but they’d survive.

- He isn’t so interested in what things mean as in what they are.

- I was seeing what the shim meant. He was seeing what the shim was.
    
    [Location: 891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=891)
    
- It’s all just parts and relationships and analyses and syntheses and figuring things out and it isn’t really here. It’s somewhere else, which thinks it’s here, but’s a million miles away. This is what it’s all about.

- It was an intrusion on his reality. It just blew a hole right through his whole groovy way of looking at things and he would not face up to it because it seemed to threaten his whole life style. In a way he was experiencing the same sort of anger scientific people have sometimes about abstract art, or at least used to have. That didn’t fit their life style either.

- The purpose of the enlargement is not to argue for him, certainly not to praise him. The purpose is to bury him – forever.
    
    [Location: 1118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1118)
    
- Although motorcycle riding is romantic, motorcycle maintenance is purely classic. The dirt, the grease, the mastery of underlying form required all give it such a negative romantic appeal that women never go near it.

- We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world.
    
    [Location: 1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1277)
    
- To see the landscape without seeing this figure is not to see the landscape at all. To reject that part of the Buddha that attends to the analysis of motorcycles is to miss the Buddha entirely.

- And when you look directly at an insane man all you see is a reflection of your own knowledge that he’s insane, which is not to see him at all.
    
    [Location: 1311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1311)
    
- A motorcycle functions entirely in accordance with the laws of reason, and a study of the art of motorcycle maintenance is really a miniature study of the art of rationality itself.
    
    [Location: 1478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1478)
    
- But to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible.

- An untrained observer will see only physical labor and often get the idea that physical labor is mainly what the mechanic does. Actually the physical labor is the smallest and easiest part of what the mechanic does. By far the greatest part of his work is careful observation and precise thinking. That is why mechanics sometimes seem so taciturn and withdrawn when performing tests. They don’t like it when you talk to them because they are concentrating on mental images, hierarchies, and not really looking at you or the physical motorcycle at all. They are using the experiment as part of a program to expand their hierarchy of knowledge of the faulty motorcycle and compare it to the correct hierarchy in their mind. They are looking at underlying form.

- He felt that institutions such as schools, churches, governments and political organizations of every sort all tended to direct thought for ends other than truth, for the perpetuation of their own functions, and for the control of individuals it is the service of these functions.

- you start looking laterally. That’s a word he later used to describe a growth of knowledge that doesn’t move forward like an arrow in flight, but expands sideways, like an arrow enlarging in flight,
    
    [Location: 1853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1853)
    
- Lateral knowledge is knowledge that’s from a wholly unexpected direction, from a direction that’s not even understood as a direction until the knowledge forces itself upon one.
    
    [Location: 1856](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=1856)
    
- He discovered that the science he’d once thought of as the whole world of knowledge is only a branch of philosophy, which is far broader and far more general.

- Unlike the Sutherlands, who hate technology, DeWeese was so far removed from it he didn’t feel it any particular menace. DeWeese was actually a technology buff, a patron of the technologies. He didn’t understand them, but he knew what he liked, and he always enjoyed learning more.
    
    [Location: 2166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=2166)
    
- To him it had revealed an incredible ignorance of what a church really was. Did they think that bricks and boards and glass constituted a church? Or the shape of the roof? Here, posing as piety was an example of the very materialism the church opposed. The building in question was not holy ground. It had been desanctified. That was the end of it. The beer sign resided over a bar, not a church, and those who couldn’t tell the difference were simply revealing something about themselves.
    
    [Location: 2282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=2282)
    
- The primary goal of the Church of Reason, Phaedrus said, is always Socrates’ old goal of truth, in its ever-changing forms, as it’s revealed by the process of rationality. Everything else is subordinate to that.

- You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.
    
    [Location: 2339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=2339)
    
- When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it’s always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.

- This was a place where he was received – as himself. Not as what he could be or should be but as himself. A place all receptive – listening. He gave everything to it. This wasn’t one room, this was a thousand rooms, changing each day with the storms and snows and patterns of clouds on the mountains, with each class, and even with each student. No

- She couldn’t think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn’t recall anything she had heard worth repeating.
    
    [Location: 2961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=2961)
    
- To live only for some future goal is shallow. It’s the sides of the mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here’s where things grow.
    
    [Location: 3163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=3163)
    
- He was trying to use the mountain for his own purposes and the pilgrimage too. He regarded himself as the fixed entity, not the pilgrimage or the mountain, and thus wasn’t ready for

- He rejects the here, is unhappy with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just as unhappy because then it will be ‘here.’ What he’s looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he doesn’t want that because it is all around him.
    
    [Location: 3285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=3285)
    
- Now, with that word removed, the sentence became ‘Quality is what you like,’ and its meaning was entirely changed. It had become an innocuous truism.
    
    [Location: 3619](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=3619)
    
- Thus, if the problem of technological hopelessness is caused by absence of care, both by technologists and antitechnologists; and if care and Quality are external and internal aspects of the same thing, then it follows logically that what really causes technological hopelessness is absence of the perception of Quality in technology by both technologists and antitechnologists.
    
    [Location: 4302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4302)
    
- Just plain stuck. In traditional maintenance this is the worst of all moments, so bad that you have avoided even thinking about it before you come to it.
    
    [Location: 4362](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4362)
    
- Traditional scientific method has always been at the very best, 20-20 hindsight. It’s good for seeing where you’ve been. It’s good for testing the truth of what you think you know, but it can’t tell you where you ought to go, unless where you ought to go is a continuation of where you were going in the past.

- The reality of the American government isn’t static, he said, it’s dynamic. If we don’t like it we’ll get something better. The
    
    [Location: 4450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4450)
    
- After all, it’s exactly this stuckness that Zen Buddhists go to so much trouble to induce; through koans, deep breathing, sitting still and the like. Your mind is empty, you have a ‘hollow-flexible’ attitude of ‘beginner’s mind.’ You’re right at the front end of the train of knowledge, at the track of reality itself.
    
    [Location: 4462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4462)
    
- What it is has ceased to be a category of thought and is a continuing direct experience. It’s not in the boxcars anymore, it’s out in front and capable of change. You are interested in what it does and why it’s doing it.
    
    [Location: 4486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4486)
    
- The way to resolve the conflict is to break down the barriers of dualistic thought that prevent a real understanding of what technology is – not an exploitation of nature, but a fusion of nature and the human spirit into a new kind of creation that transcends both. When this transcendence occurs in such events as the first airplane flight across the ocean or the first footsteps on the moon, a kind of public recognition of the transcendent nature of technology occurs. But this transcendence should also occur at the individual level, on a personal basis, in one’s own life, in a less dramatic way.
    
    [Location: 4550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4550)
    
- Such personal transcendence of conflicts with technology doesn’t have to involve motorcycles, of course. It can be at a level as simple as sharpening a kitchen knife or sewing a dress or mending a broken chair. The underlying problems are the same. In each case there’s a beautiful way of doing it and an ugly way of doing it, and in arriving at the high-quality, beautiful way of doing it, both an ability to see what ‘looks good’ and an ability to understand the underlying methods to arrive at that ‘good’ are needed. Both classic and romantic understandings of Quality must be combined.

- But the returned fisherman usually has a peculiar abundance of gumption, usually for the very same things he was sick to death of a few weeks before. He hasn’t been wasting time. It’s only our limited cultural viewpoint that makes it seem so.
    
    [Location: 4748](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4748)
    
- them away, because they won’t do you any good. Gumption is the psychic gasoline that keeps the whole thing going.

- Motorcycle maintenance gets frustrating. Angering. Infuriating. That’s what makes it interesting.
    
    [Location: 4766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=4766)
    
- You’re looking right at them, but they don’t yet have enough value. This is what Phaedrus was talking about. Quality, value, creates the subjects and objects of the world. The facts do not exist until value has created them. If your values are rigid you can’t really learn new facts.

- . I was going to say that the machine doesn’t respond to your personality, but it does respond to your personality. It’s just that the personality that it responds to is your real personality, the one that genuinely feels and reasons and acts, rather than any false, blown-up personality images your ego may conjure up.

- Mu simply says, ‘No class; not one, not zero, not yes, not no.’ It states that the context of the question is such that a yes or no answer is in error and should not be given.
    
    [Location: 5021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=5021)
    
- When the Zen monk Joshu was asked whether a dog had a Buddha nature he said ‘Mu,’ meaning that if he answered either way he was answering incorrectly.

- Insanity is the terra incognita surrounding the mythos.
    
    [Location: 5484](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=5484)
    
- Because Quality is the generator of the mythos.

- ‘What moves the Greek warrior to deeds of heroism,’ Kitto comments, ‘is not a sense of duty as we understand it – duty towards others: it is rather duty towards himself. He strives after that which we translate “virtue” but is in Greek aretê, “excellence” . . . we shall have much to say about aretê. It runs through Greek life.’
    
    [Location: 5890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0063HC7EQ&location=5890)
    
- Phaedrus is fascinated too by the description of the motive of 'duty toward self' which is an almost exact translation of the Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes described as the ‘one’ of the Hindus.
