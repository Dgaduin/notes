# Content Has Purpose, Around Which Design Has to Happen

#design

Things have names, and need to be verbed.Â Defining the names and the verbs is the most important part of UX.

When you fail to grapple directly with the [[../../003-ðŸ“š-knowledge/nobody-reads|actual content]], but focus on designing boxes for whatever the content will be, what youâ€™re actually doing is putting [[colour-is-meaningless|pretty boxes]] between the user and their goals. Design the content, and youâ€™ll probably be just about done.
