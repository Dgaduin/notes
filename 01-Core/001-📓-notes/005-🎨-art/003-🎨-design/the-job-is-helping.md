# The Job is to Help the User Achieve His Goal

#design

Your job is to help the user achieve their goal. Navigating an interface is [[dont-move-shit-around|never the user’s goal]]. If you’d done your job right, the app would only do one thing, and would do it very well, and would do it all on one screen.
