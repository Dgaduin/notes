# Colour is Meaningless

#design

The only things you can communicate with colour are:

- **Any colour:** this thing has a colour.
- **A different colour:** this thing is not the same as the other thing.
- **Gray:** this thing is broken.
- **Red:** the designer hates you and wants to make you angry.

> Colour is not verbal or rational. It’s contextual and emotional. It’s powerful, not meaningful.
