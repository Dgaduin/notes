# Knowledge Vectors

#knowledge #self/todo/to-expand

Information in a relationship system establishes graph structures of directed notes - possible conclusions from a concept or side notes, which can be connected to already existing ideas and form a new direction of thought. Due to this cause and consequence relation in ideas, we can build the concept of a knowledge vector, since any note with a parent, has a direction of thought, has content (magnitude), and can be combined with other vectors to produce a new idea, which has a new direction and content. In addition to the mathematical concept, the term also connects really well with the biological term,[^1] which means an origin of an infectious agent, especially when concerned with the virility and adaptivity of ideas.
