# Convention Based Build Scripts

#tech/paradigm/code-quality

Root folder which has a list of scripts to perform different actions:

- Setup dependencies
- Fetch remote resources
- Start local server
- Generate container image
- Create a build
- Run tests

> I love how simple[^1] it can be to tell anyone to clone the project and run these steps:

```bash
cd path/to/project
./bin/setup
./bin/start
```
