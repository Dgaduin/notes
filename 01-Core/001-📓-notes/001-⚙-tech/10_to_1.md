# 10:1

#writing #tech/paradigm/code-quality

The 10:1 rule of writing and programming:

> Good software and good writing requires that every line has been rewritten, on average, at least 10 times.

There is a natural churn of thoughts as a piece of code or writing evolves giving, meaning most of what we do won't last in the same form it has started in.
