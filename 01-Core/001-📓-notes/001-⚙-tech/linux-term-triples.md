# Linux Terminal Symbols

#tech/platform/linux/terminal

- `Ctrl+i, Ctrl+Shift+i, Tab`
- `Ctrl+j, Ctrl+Shift+j, Enter`
- `Ctrl+[, Ctrl+Shift+[, Escape`
- `Ctrl+d, Ctrl+Shift+d, EOF`
- `Ctrl+g, Ctrl+Shift+g, BEL`

Key points:

- When you rebind any one of those triples, you rebind all of them
- You cannot have separate keybindings for any two or three members of a triple
- `Ctrl+char` and `Ctrl+Shift+char` are not distinct.
