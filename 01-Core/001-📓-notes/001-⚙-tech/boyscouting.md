# Boyscouting

#tech/paradigm/code-quality

The Boy Scouts motto:

> Leave it better than you found it.

Applied to development, this means eliminating dead code, removing comments, and standardizing format.

Boyscouting does not change code, only cleans it.

Boyscouting is not refactoring.

Boyscouting is not fixing bugs.

During boyscouting, looking for [[duct_tape|duct tape]] and marking it is useful.
