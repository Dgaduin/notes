# ASP Lazy DI

#tech/language/dotnet/aspcore #tech/language/dotnet/lazy

Sometimes it bight be better to resolve the runtime dependencies in [[aspcore_framework|ASP Core]] lazily, e.g. in multi-dependent controllers where we might not need all dependencies for all calls.

	

To achieve that we can use the DI factory overloads with the [[csharp_lazy|Lazy<T>]] delegate constructor.

	

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services
    	.AddScoped<IRepo, Repo>()
    Â Â Â Â .AddScoped(x => 
			new Lazy<IRepo>(() => 
				x.GetRequiredService<IRepo>()));
}
```
