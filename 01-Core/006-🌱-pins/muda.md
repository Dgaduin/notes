# Muda

Muda is a Lean engineering catch-all term for non-value-added activities, namely waste. Do you recognise any of these in your own company?

Wrong work: building functionality no one uses, or the wrong functionality due to a lack of understanding

Watching the watchers: updating the PMO before they update the portfolio director before they update the VP before….

Old routines: attending a bi-weekly portfolio review because, well, we’ve always done it

Late engagement: a post-dev security gate review highlighting an issue, delaying deployment

Mismatched priorities: waiting on a Cloud Centre of Excellence to prioritise and build a new AMI

Slow approvals: waiting for a quarterly review to get approval to move to the next stage of development

Too many chiefs: decisions being made but overturned by someone else who claims to have the decision-making rights
