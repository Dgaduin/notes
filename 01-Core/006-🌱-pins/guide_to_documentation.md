Project documentation

You may well ask: where do things like changelogs, contribution policies, and other information about the project fit into this scheme? The answer is that they do not - because they are, strictly speaking, project documentation rather than documentation of the software itself,

They can simply be kept in appropriately-named sections alongside the other material - as long as they are not mixed up in it.
