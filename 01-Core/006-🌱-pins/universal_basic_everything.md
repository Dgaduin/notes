Rights of Future Generations statutes - policies on questioning inherit assumptions about rights [^1]

Universal Basic Everything is the idea that there are systems, tangible and intangible, that we need to survive and thrive. These relationships and friendships, products and services need to be co-created, accessible to everyone, open source, simple in their design, circular in their production.[^2] Cooperation on a local level seems to be the next step forward in rebuilding an engaged society, regarding its regional needs. This also gives people the option to participate on their own terms. A modern take on the anarchist cooperatives? Makes sense that after a obvious fail and show of fragility on the global markets, and the lack of a connection between the quality of live and the stock exchange, people want to focus on local.
