# Untitled 4 1

Agile is a specific context; a context where the team is co-located; the customer is readily available; there are a high number of automated unit and integration tests, and the team works in the smallest increment possible.

There are contexts where that work; and lots of contexts where that can fail pretty hard: like when you’re modernizing an existing system through a rewrite.  

If you find your developers are often confused as to what they’re delivering, or they keep needing to revisit their design or implementation; then one of the first places to look whether or not the team has chosen to visually diagram how the technical pieces fit together.  

P.S., It’s worth noting the agile pillar says “over”, not “Instead of”. Agile teams value working software _over_ comprehensive documentation, but sometimes you need that documentation to get to the working software part.
