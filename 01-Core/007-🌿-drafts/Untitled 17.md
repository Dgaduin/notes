[Gandalf was really just fighter with INT18.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3jpksw/gandalf_was_really_just_fighter_with_int18/)

Gandalf lied, he was no wizard. He was clearly a high level fighter that had put points in the Use Magic Device skill allowing him to wield a staff of wizardry. All of his magic spells he cast were low level, easily explained by his ring of spell storing and his staff. For such an epic level wizard he spent more time fighting than he did casting spells. He presented himself as this angelic demigod, when all he was a fighter with carefully crafted PR.

His combat feats were apparent. He has proficiency in the long sword, but he also is a trained dual weapon fighter. To have that level of competency to wield both weapons you are looking at a dexterity of at least 17, coupled with the Monkey Grip feat to be able to fight with a quarter staff one handed in his off hand at that. Three dual weapon fighting feats, monkey grip, and martial weapon proficiency would take up 5 of his 7 feats as a wizard, far too many to be an effective build. That's why when he faced a real wizard like Sarumon, he got stomped in a magic duel. He had taken no feats or skills useful to a wizard. If he had used his sword he would have carved up Sarumon without effort.

The spells he casts are all second level or less. He casts spook on Bilbo to snap him out his ring fetish. When he's trapped on top of Isengard an animal messenger spell gets him help. Going into Moria he uses his staff to cast light. Facing the Balrog all he does is cast armor. Even in the Two Towers his spells are limited. Instead of launching a fireball into the massed Uruk Hai he simply takes 20 on a nature check to see when the sun will crest the hill and times his charge appropriately. Sarumon braced for a magic duel over of the body of Theodin, which Gandalf gets around with a simple knock on the skull. Since Sarumon has got a magic jar cast on Theodin, the wizard takes the full blow as well breaking his concentration. Gandalf stops the Hunters assault on him by parrying two missile weapons, another fighter feat, and then casting another first level spell in heat metal. Return of the King has Gandalf using light against the Nazgul and that is about it. When the trolls, orcs and Easterlings breach the gates of Minos Tiroth does he unload a devastating barrage of spells at the tightly pack foes? No, he charges a troll and kills it with his sword. That is the action of a fighter, not a wizard.

Look at how he handled the Balrog, not with sorcery but with skill. The Balrog approached and Gandalf attempts to intimidate him, clearly a fighter skill. After uses his staff to cast armor, a first level spell, Gandalf then makes a engineering check, another fighter skill, to see that the bridge will not support the Balrog's weight. When the Balrog took a step, the bridge collapsed under its weight. Gandalf was smart enough to know the break point, and positioned himself just far enough back not to go down with the Balrog. The Balrog's whip got lucky with a critical hit knocking Gandalf off balance. The whole falling part was due to a lack of over sight on behalf of the party, seriously how does a ranger forget to bring a rope? Gandalf wasn't saved by divine forces after he hit the bottom, he merely soaked up the damage because he was sitting on 20d10 + constitution bonus worth of hit points.

So why the subterfuge? Because it was the perfect way to lure in his enemies. Everybody knows in a fight to rush the wizard before he can do too much damage. But if the wizard is actually an epic level fighter, the fools rush to their doom. Gandalf, while not a wizard, is extremely intelligent. He knows how his foes would respond. Nobody wants to face a heavily armored dwarf, look at Gimli's problem finding foes to engage in cave troll fight. But an unarmored wizard? That's the target people seek out, before he can use his firepower on you. If the wizard turns out to actually be a high level fighter wearing robes, then he's already in melee when its his turn and can mop the floor with the morons that charged him. So remember fighters, be like Gandalf. Fight smarter, not harder.

I always thought Saruman's quote from Fellowship on the "Halfing's leaf" was the most telling part.

"Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind."

Gandalf just spent too much time getting high, and forgot most of his spells, so he reverted to hitting things with a stick. I meanat the outset he's basically just a stoner homeless guy who likes to go to parties and bring fireworks.

Throughout The Hobbit and Fellowship, he shows up late, either for a party or to throw a party and invite a bunch of strangers to a place where he is pretty sure there will be the weed he loves. Then he gets high and gets the idea to do something reckless and everyone follows along because he's supposed to be an all-powerful wizard.

So he makes a bunch of mistakes, almost gets everyone killed or caught a bunch of times, forgets what he should be doing, keeps running off to do something else whenever he's given the opportunity - All while his friends and strangers are stuck dealing with his shenanigans.

He's supposedly one of the most powerful beings in the lore, and Tolkien makes a point to show he forgot what the ring of power was in the first place, so he has to go to a library basically a few countries away and dig through a bunch of old books before he figures out, "Oh shitit's that thing that could kill us all.."

Let's stop to look at Saruman.

Saruman was just trying to find a friend, albeit his friend corrupted him in the long runbut look at the "White Wizard's" peers:

The 2 blue wizards who were off - in the eastdoing who knows what. Radagast, the hippie stoner who never showered and wouldn't stop eating mushrooms. Gandalf, the homeless stoner who kept hanging out with all those carnival folk who never wear shoes.

Saruman gets sick of it, and gets on an AOL chat room and meets the Dark Lord. Someone who loves Metal, puts flames on everything and has a bunch of badass minions with piercings and muscles and giant black towers just like Saruman's. So he makes friends.

Next thing Saruman knows, his old stoner roommate rolls up and says, "Hey, I'm going to kick this Sauron guy's ass bro, you gonna roll with me?"

So Saruman kicks his ass, pouts for a bit and then gets back to building his army.

While Gandalf is detoxing in the roof, he finally remembers he has some eagle friends who have bailed him out before, so he sends them a quick message.

Then Gandalf gets right back to ruining everyone's week be running around and asking for favors and meanwhile a bunch of little people are being chased by some of the most absolutely unbelievably horrific things that they wouldn't even have known to have nightmares about before Gandalf came around.

Apparently after he meets back up with the crew, and after literally everyone is fighting over the situation, he lets the little dudes take the ring to the worst place ever with absolutely no idea what he was getting into or where he was going.

So, he lets the little guy, who has never been anywhere near where they are going, nor does he have any idea how to get there, lead the way.

So, after some debatelets Frodo pick the way to go. And Gandalf is terrified to go the way he picks, though he doesn't remember why. This of course gets them into probably the worst case scenarioas he forgets how to even get in, forgets which way they should go, snaps at others who question himand doesn't remember that the Balrog is there until it's basically right on top of them.

Then, when he LITERALLY hit rock bottom, while LITERALLY taking steps in dealing with his demon, he wakes up, cleaned himself up and went back out into the world with a new haircut, new attitude, and he then raced around trying to atone for all of his mistakes.

LOTR is just the story of the skeevy homeless stoner from The Hobbit getting clean and trying to atone for all the shit he caused while High.
