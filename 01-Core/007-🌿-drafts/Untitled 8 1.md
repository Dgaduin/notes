# Untitled 8 1

auslegung

\> Code should be 1) correct 2) secure 3) readable 4) elegant 5) altruist

This is a great companion to the adage "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." I would map "Make it work" to #1 and "make it right" to #2 - #4.

I don't quite see a clear mapping with "make it fast" to any levels of the pyramid, nor #5 with any statement in the adage, though that doesn't mean there are any problems with either.
