d&d paladin idea

on trial, the knights templar were accused of worshiping a severed head. by some accounts, the head of medusa.

imagine, holy knights who secretly kneel before the martyred gorgon. their initiation rites require they meet her lifeless gaze and withstand its petrifying curse.

those who fail join the statues standing sentry atop their cathedral.

but those who prevail are fortified by patches of calcified flesh, can extend this protection to others, and restrain enemies where they stand, hardening their skin at a glance.

the terrible truth is, even those who survive these rites are slowly being turned to stone–though they cease to age–relying on magic salves and ointments to hold petrification at bay.

they shall all adorn that cathedral in the end, watching over the exiled and afflicted, awaiting the day that their serpent-haired patron restores them to flesh for a heavenly cause.
