[TIL that there is a traditional European custom called "telling the bees," where bees would be informed about important events like deaths, births, and marriages; and that if the bees were not properly informed people feared they would leave the hive, stop pollinating or producing honey, or die](https://daily.jstor.org/telling-the-bees/) ([daily.jstor.org](https://www.reddit.com/domain/daily.jstor.org/))

> Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.
