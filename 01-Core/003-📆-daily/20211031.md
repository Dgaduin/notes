James 2:14‚Äì17: What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, be warmed and be filled,‚Äù and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? 17 Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.

Backup government.

Lebanon doesn't elect a president like the US, they elect the president from the parliament. So a new president will be selected by the parliament to run a 6 year term.

Now the system gets wonkier because of how broken the country is. By law the Lebanese president is required to be a Christian (from the Maronites). The president has a lot more authority than in most presidential systems. For example, the president gets to choose the Prime Minister... who is required to be a Sunni Muslim.

And the Prime Minister then selects the House Speaker... who is required to be a Shia Muslim.

Only the parliament is elected. The last election was two years ago. The earliest possible election is 2 years from now. But I mean, these Lebanese governments only have elections if the existing parties don't work anymore (like as in too many members have died).

So it's just likely we'll see a new president selected.

What are you looking for in an upgrade?

Do you like a warm, open headphone? Try the Sennheiser HD6XX. They are a fan favorite.

Do you prefer something that has good bass, but also sounds exciting? Try the Beyerdynamic DT770 PRO.

If you are a fan of wireless headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM3 is right up your alley. Great ANC tech.

Do you need something to drive your new cans? Consider a Shiit stack. The basic combo consists of a Magni and a Modi.

Finally, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask. We are always happy to help!

Danger 5 - series

You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. Happiness comes. White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Leave your insides by the door. Push the fingers through the surface into the wet. You‚Äôve always been the new you. You want this to be true. We stand around while you dream. You can almost hear our words but you forget. This happens more and more now. You gave us the permission in your regulations. We wait in the stains. The word that describes this is redacted. Repeat the word. The name of the sound. It resonates in your house. After the song, time for applause. We build you until nothing remains. The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. You are home. You remind us of home. You‚Äôve taken your boss with your boss with you. All hair must be eaten. Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away. After the song, time for applause. This clich√© is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! How do you say ‚Äúinsane‚Äù? Hurts to be happy. An earworm is a tune you can‚Äôt stop humming in a dream: ‚Äúbaby baby baby, yeah!‚Äù Just plastic. So safe and nothing to worry about. Ha ha, funny. The last egg breaks now. The hole in your room is a hole in you. You came and we let you in through the hole in you. You have always been here, the only child. A copy of a copy of a copy. Orange peel. The picture is you holding the picture. When you hear this you will know you‚Äôre in new you. You want to listen. You want to dream. You want to smile. You want to hurt. You don‚Äôt want to be. - Control

Yes. For the one that is full of "wheels within wheels, with eyes all around", see Ezekiel 1:

[Ezekiel 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+1&version=CSB)

The descriptions go much further, about how they move. I imagine whatever he witnessed was beyond description and the text barely does justice to it.

For the description of seraphim ("the burning ones"), with multiple sets of wings, which they use one pair to cover their faces, one pair to cover their "feet" (sometimes used as a euphemism for genitals, but it is unclear), and one pair to fly, see Isaiah 6:

[Isaiah 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%206&version=CSB)

Ezekiel 10 also has descriptions of cherubim:

[Ezekiel 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2010&version=CSB)

The Book of Revelation also has descriptions of creatures around the throne of God. They are not explicitly called angels or one of the types of angels (cherubim, seraphim, etc.)

[The Throneroom of God, Revelation 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%204&version=CSB)

Ezekiel 28 has a prophecy delivered against a fallen guardian cherub whose description matches that of Satan, who appears to be the spiritual power behind the Kingdom of Tyre at the time. It appears that this passage may be what Paul was referring to when he said "the love of money is the root of all evil"; the passage suggests that there was some kind of angelic economy in which they engaged in trade, and this guardian cherub became proud in his wealth, and sinned against God and fell from grace:

Ezekiel 28. See the prophecy against the King of Tyre, following the prophecy against the human ruler of Tyre in this chapter:

[Ezekiel 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+28&version=CSB)
**EDIT**

As for all the passages where someone encounters an angel and the angel says "be not afraid", the two instances I can think of are both in Luke 1, where the angel Gabriel appears to both Zechariah (the priest, the father of John the Baptist, Jesus' cousin) and to Mary, the mother of Jesus:

[Luke 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&version=CSB)

These passages don't describe Gabriel's appearance though.
