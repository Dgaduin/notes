# Base element

#html

You can set conditions for all links in the document, by stating them in base.

```html
<head>
   <base target="_blank">
 </head>
```  

In this example, I'm putting `target="_blank"` in base. Now all links will open in a new tab. Neat!
You can also make all links point the same URL, I could have done `base href="https://some-url-here"` as well.
One small tip: base shouldn't have a closing tag.
