$ git shortlog -sn --all --no-merges

The shortlog gives us summaries of git log; the -s flag will suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary only, and the -n flag will sort output according to the number of commits per author instead of author alphabetic order. The --all flag logs all branches, and --no-merges ensures that merge commits aren’t being counted.
The above shows all commits for the lifetime of the project, but if you want to see how much people have done during a specified timeframe, you can use the --since and --until flags:

$ git shortlog -sn --since='10 weeks' --until='2 weeks'

I have this aliased to $ git stats.

It’s not uncommon for me to jump between lots of different branches on any given project, and keeping track of them can be pretty tricky. We can get Git to help us work this out:

$ git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format="%(refname:short)"
This will show us the last 10 (--count=10) branches that we worked on, sorted by the time that we were last working there. It only shows us local branches (refs/heads/) and in a much nicer --format.
This is a bit verbose to commit to memory, so I have it aliased to $ git recent.

$ git commit --amend --no-edit
This amends your staged changes into your most recent commit without changing its commit message (so Git won’t open a text editor!)

  last = log -1 HEAD

lo = log --oneline -n 10
