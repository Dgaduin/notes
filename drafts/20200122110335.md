Reusable code in Toolbox
Visual Studio provides a great feature that lets you place code snippets inside the Toolbox. Just select a code snippet and drag the selected snippet to the General tab.
This feature will be very useful when you need to use a code snippet in multiple files or in multiple places. When working on a project, youâ€™ll often copy code from your current page and paste it in another page or location. You lose time scrolling and finding the files or places where you want to paste common code snippets.
Visual Studio provides space in the Toolbox where you can keep common code. From the Toolbox, you can just drag a code snippet and drop it wherever you want.
To keep your common code in the Toolbox, just open the Toolbox and expand the General tab. Here, you can drop your selected code blocks by dragging them from the code editor. In the following screenshot, we have selected three lines of code and dragged them to the General tab.

Saving Code in the Toolbox
You can also rename your code blocks for easy reference. In the following 
screenshot, I have renamed the code block as TestMethod. I can just drag TestMethod from the Toolbox to any page or any place to use it.
