I just finished it this week. I've been looking forward to posting this here since January. Thanks /r/diy for all the inspiration!
EDIT: Common questions I've been getting on repeat:
	• Where did you get the schematic posters? www.squadronposters.com
	• Where did you get the barstools? Kirklands store in the midwest
	• _sacat=0&_nkw=hgu-55&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR6.TRC2.A0.H0.Xhgu-55.TRS0&Where does one get a helmet? HGU-55/P can be bought on eBay: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40
	• How much did it cost? I was going to contract out and finish my basement (white walls/carpet) for $20K because it increases the value of my house roughly $20K based on other home sales that have done the same in the neighborhood....After thinking about it and getting some help from my neighbors who DIY'd their basements I decided to contracted out $10K or so and then do a bunch myself. Take that savings and dump it into an epic bar build. So I did plumbing, electrical, paint, doors, floor, trim & HVAC myself and then the bar breakdown cost is:
	• $600 for the two fridges
	• $1500 for a ready to assemble cabinets deal with the extra doors for the curved bar
	• Paint $200 (columns had to color match the cabinet doors)
	• Concrete countertops $1000 for molds, concrete and polishing kit. 
	• Backsplash fake stone $500ish. 
	• Sink $300. 
	• All other misc wood for the bar for custom build curved part/beams/trim and columns $1000. 
	• LED lights/chandelier/pub lights $500. 
	• Total cost for this bar is roughly $6,000.....BUT I think I spent roughly 900 hours on it over 6-9 months. Biggest ROI was TWO months of reddit gold :) thanks everyone for checking it out.
