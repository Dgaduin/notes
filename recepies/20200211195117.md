2-Ingredient Never-Fail Cream Biscuits Recipe
These two-ingredient biscuits have one of the lowest effort-to-greatness ratios of any recipe I can think of. They take practically no effort or practice to pull off, yet produce some of the lightest, tenderest, tastiest biscuits around.

Why It Works
Self-rising flour is softer than standard wheat flour which makes for more tender biscuits.
Heavy cream takes the place of the butter and buttermilk in a standard biscuit recipe.
YIELD:
Makes 15 to 20 biscuits
ACTIVE TIME:
5 minutes
TOTAL TIME:
17 minutes
Ingredients
10 ounces (about 2 cups) self-rising flour
2 tablespoons sugar (if making sweet shortcake-style biscuits)
10 ounces (about 1 1/4 cups) heavy cream, plus more for brushing
Directions
1.
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F. Place flour in a large bowl. If making sweet biscuits, whisk in sugar. Stirring with a wooden spoon, drizzle in cream. Stir until a lumpy dough is formed. Do not over mix.

2.
For Drop Biscuits: Using a 1-ounce cookie scoop, scoop balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. Brush tops with cream and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.

3.
For Flaky Rolled Biscuits: With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch square. Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the dough over the center, then fold the left third over so you end up with a 12-by-4-inch rectangle. Fold the top third down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 4-inch square. Press the square down and roll it out again into a 12-inch square. Repeat the folding process once more, then roll the dough again into a 12-inch square. Use a 3- to 4-inch biscuit cutter to cut out rounds and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spaced 2 inches apart. Press together scraps to form additional biscuits. Brush tops with cream and bake until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.
