Soy-Balsamic Vinaigrette Recipe
Note: This recipe can easily be scaled up or down, and lasts forever in the fridge. If you have plastic squeeze bottles, there's no need to first whisk in a bowl—construct the dressing in the bottles using the same ratio of ingredients, scaling down to fit in one bottle. Cover the top and shake before each use.
