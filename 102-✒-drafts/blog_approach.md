# Blog approach

#self/todo/pin

Whenever I get pitches from our engineers, regardless of the topic, the first question I ask myself is, "Why should a reader care?" Readers don't just want to look at a blog post and say, "Cool, Company X did this thing...." and that's it. At the very least, they want to understand:

    Why was this approach taken?  
    
    What went into deciding on that approach?  
    
    What is this [topic/software/etc] that was chosen and why?  
    
    What lessons came out of it?
