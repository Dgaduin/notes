I'd love for any of these tools to offer :
*1 Explicit Document ownership. The primary author, as well as team distro list slapped at the top.

*2 Document aging. If a doc goes over X days without review by the author or team, it is listed at the top in yellow/red/etc as some level of "Stale" so others know. This also has the slight shame effect if you're the primary owner and all of your docs are bright red and stale.

*3. Directory structure template that you enforce on your entire org. So when a new team starts, you can have some sort of standardization stamped out around where things are like Design Docs, Runbooks, Meeting notes, etc, etc
