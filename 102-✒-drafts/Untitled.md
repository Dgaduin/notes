Sitting at the park today an older Japanese man came up to us, reached into his pockets and pulled out handfuls of acorns.

"Donguri" he said. He explained that acorns fall from trees this time of year and pointed out which trees they came from. He said different trees produce

different types of acorns, as he reached into another pocket and pulled out even more acorns, these longer, more yellow.

"What do you do with them?" I asked.

"I give them to children" he said, and handed us each an acorn. He thanked us and walked away, back into the trees.

There are many things I still do not understand about this interaction.

For one thing, I am 32. Two, why thank US after handing us the acorns? Three, what do I do with this acorn?

I do not know the answers, but I hope you find great bounties of acorns, Donguri Man.
