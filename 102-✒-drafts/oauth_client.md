# OAuth Client

#tech/paradigm/oauth/openidconnect

The OAuth client's job is to request tokens from a security token provider, either a [[oauth_identity-token|identity token]](for authentication) or a [[oauth_access-token|access token]](for accessing secured [[102-âœ’-drafts/idnetity-server_resource|resources]]). It has configured [[oauth_scope|scopes]] to which it has access.
