# Book club of hell

> AWS purportedly puts design documents forward in the form of six-pagers. They start meetings with a 20 minute silent reading session. It's like the book club from hell.

Not just AWS- that's an Amazon-wide technique. And it's freaking amazing. You should try it.
Look, there's two other options. 1- let someone bullshit you with PowerPoint for an hour and skim over critical details. 2- send out the doc ahead of time for everyone to read before the meeting and have every single attendee say "ah yeah I only had time to skim it, but looks good to me". Wasted time.
The Amazon design review meeting involves no bullshitting, no homework before the meeting that gets skipped. We all arrive. We read the entire doc, on paper, red pens in hand. Then we dive into questions on the important bits and anything circled by those red pens.
Generally takes a lot less time as far as meetings go.
