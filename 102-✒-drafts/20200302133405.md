ðŸ’¡ NOTE:Task.Factory.StartNew has an option TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning that under the covers creates a new thread and returns a Task that represents the execution. Using this properly requires several non-obvious parameters to be passed in to get the right behavior on all platforms.

ðŸ’¡ NOTE: Don't use TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning with async code as this will create a new thread which will be destroyed after first await.
