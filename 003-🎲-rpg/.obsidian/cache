They see themselves as descendants of the legendary Bee Collective. Blessed by the Queen God Aiola and her unhatched children (the 3 moons). They are secluded on top of the giant tree mountains, and usually avoid harm’s way. Due to the diverse ecosystem on the trees, the ant colonies are rarely able to reach the Silken Cities of the Moths.Legend tells of 4 tribal matriarchs uniting and forming the Cocoon Collective thousands of years ago. Their innate flying ability allowed them to focus on their own culture and needs. While distant, conflict is not unknown to them - they have fought for territory and resources as any other Collective, but have since opted for diplomacy where feasible. They believe that Ranged combat is as barbaric as the Fire ants and their poison spitting - if Moths are to fight, they believe that the warrior should see and feel the enemy, as they slay or are slain. Initiating a fight without honor is a sure way to be shunned in society.They are also a  very religious and mystical society - they worship the ","afterContext":", and believe to be the chosen race of Ryyun.One of the only societies on the planet to successfully reach space (due to their proximity to the heavens), and fascination with Aiola. Butterflies and some Dragonfly nomads are said to also have explored spaced. The former, gave up quickly due to their narcissism and hedonism (Butterflies are often the butt of Moth jokes). While the latter lack any societal structure to support such extreme adventures.While in their history, 4 tribes and 4 matriarchs ruled over their vast Heavenly Kingdom, for the past couple of millennia the Collective has been ruled by an absolute Matriarch Queen. She is chosen after the death of the previous ruler, by a council of mystics, scientists, feudal lords and worker organizers. The criteria used is the Queen’s life work up until this choice.There are different “roles” into which a Moth can be born into. Given their metamorphosis stages, consciousness isn’t always a given. No one Moth remembers its previous Larva incarnation, but it is undeniable that their body came to be from it. And scientists have proven that during the Larva stage, the future Moth’s talents and gifts can be observed - for example, a Moth which would grow specialize in the Arts of practical weaving (tools, objects, weapons), can be seen to spin itself cocoons of incredibly specific and geometric patterns as a Larva; another, which would rather be an engineering weaver(infrastructure, buildings, machinery), warrior moth have a longer larvae stage of development, the most “promising” of which spend their first life crafting the weapon of their choice; mystical Moths’ larvae sometimes do not produce Silk cocoons at all, and have to be assisted by another Larva or Moth, in order to proceed. This lack of Silk production carries on in their next incarnation.The 4 initial Tribes’ wing patterns can still be seen today, however at this point the gene-pool has merged, and all kinds of variations between upper and lower wing combinations can be seen.There are several specific archetypes of Moth, when the pattern of wing couples match:– Mystics (1) - religious and spiritual - not quite adept at silk spinning - could be scientific, rather than mystical. -– Guardians (2) - warriors built combat - strongest and most resilient of Moths - okay Silk weaving skills - Royal Guardians and soldiers– Scouts (3) - fastest and most agile of Moths - usually scouts in war, “astronauts”, athletes - Silk weaving skills are quite advanced– Carriers (4) - heavy lifters and marathon fliers - wing structure allows for effortless gliding - Silk weaving skills are quite advancedHowever, with  the various combinations, individuals get to discover their talents and lack of such throughout their life. Some Moths are ridiculed for their “non-optimal” heritage. Due to the variety, it’s hard to classify them.There is another type of Moth, and it is the Queen Moth. They are wingless Moths, who are often 2-3x size of other Moths. They hatch and care for eggs, and have powerful sonar systems to communicate commands and news to Moths far away. Due to their lack of flight, any Queen has her entourage of caretakers and supporters, but without them, they cannot last for long. But if cared for, Queen Moths can live and rule for hundreds of years."}],"embeds":[{"line":28,"link":"moths_01.jpg","original":"![[moths_01.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_02.jpg","original":"![[moths_02.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_03.jpg","original":"![[moths_03.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_04.jpg","original":"![[moths_04.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_05.jpg","original":"![[moths_05.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_06.jpg","original":"![[moths_06.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_07.jpg","original":"![[moths_07.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_08.jpg","original":"![[moths_08.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_09.jpg","original":"![[moths_09.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""},{"line":28,"link":"moths_10.jpg","original":"![[moths_10.jpg]]","beforeContext":"","afterContext":""}],"tags":[],"headings":[{"line":0,"heading":"The Cocoon Collective of Aiola","level":1}]},"8d449c80f4d9ba8bf7155d927421aa5e17ad14a93edbb9cd83a3d37709a666e6":{"links":[{"line":1,"link":"/species/dahab_species","original":"[[/species/dahab_species|Dahab species]]","displayText":"Dahab species","beforeContext":"The Dahab empire is a multi-sector spanning monarchy and home to the ","afterContext":".They have been around since forever and have been at the bottom of almost every big conflict around, due to the longevity of it’s people and their tendency to have to recycle memory space.They have a highly structured cast system.The empire is probably the only stand alone fleet that can match the HFSHFS in terms of numbers and guns.They tend to favor gold and teal as their colors, and consider non-energy based guns to be barbaric.
