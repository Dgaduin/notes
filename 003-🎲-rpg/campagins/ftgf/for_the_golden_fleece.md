### Timeline 
The setting is set in the early 9000s. Humanity has been space faring since the late 2000s, but managed to acquire FTL travel capabilities in the mid 4000s, first by using ion acceleration, and then by plugging in the galaxy-wide [[mcs|mass catapult system]].

### Scale
The Milky Way, mostly. 

### Cultures
The universe is large and full of .... weird, and Humans are a small part of it. The [[the_independent_galactic_census|IGS]] recognizes at least 2,495,237 species with FTL capabilities, and more than 70,000 sovereign organizations, participating in the galaxy, from pirate crypto-syndicates , exploration federations, independent asteroid republics and cross planet trade empires.

#### Trade
The core of the galactic economy are trading ships. From 3 person freighters to 10,000 crew arks, trade supplies the galaxy with weapons, food and rare tech. Most of those ships work for one of the many trade companies as independent contractors.

### Tech

#### Weapons
Weapons in the galaxy span the full range of rare metal martial heirlooms, to the equivalent of ray-based pipe guns. Most common are energy cell based "laser" guns, due to the fact that hull punctures in space are not recommended for long term living privileges. Ships usually have universal defense arrays, covering most common space offenses like missiles/torpedoes, energy fire or smaller spacecraft.

#### Teleports
Most race's don't fare well enough when disintegrated and reassembled, so teleports are rare, but some energy-based life forms and artificials can use short range radiation based transport. It's costly in terms of power, but it's rumored some of the [[the_high_frequency_traders_union|HFT]] ships have full hull jump capabilities. 

#### FTL
[[mcs|Mass catapult systen relays]] work by generating, extremely high velocities, usually by attaching a grav-anchor in a near-star orbit, and accelerating ships to 3-5C, and somehow breaking the laws of physics - I don't know, ask a scientist. They won't know either. Deceleration happens in big gravity wells like black holes, or similar anomalies to allow for smoother entry into civilized space.
Ships need to be equipped with a inertia dampeners, unless you want to turn the crew and cargo in pate. 
Some large ships come with one-off deployable relays, in case they got lost in space, and some of the exploration fleets have been experimenting with alternative drives, but those are way to unreliable for mass use. 

#### FTL communication
Not possible unless you catapult an object. Usually most ships act as sync servers for pan-galactic data. 

#### Food
The food variety in the galaxy is large, but humans get to claim their two major contributions to galactic society - soy and cargo worms. Those 2 ingredients, due to their unoffensive baseline are widely used in food synths to produce some-what passing variants of almost all know edible foods. 

#### AI 
AI is widely developed and accepted most places, although mostly specialized. The exceptions are mega structure AI cores the size of a small planet or evolved high-adversary general intellects, which tend to stay away from sapients due to reasonable paranoia. 

#### Money
Most trade companies issue their own credits, which can vary in value, but are generally accepted almost everywhere those companies operate. Some regions require the use of local government currency, or encourage barter. 

## DM Notes
