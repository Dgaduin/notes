# The Cocoon Collective of Aiola
The Cocoon Collective of Aiola- the kingdom of the Moths. They see themselves as descendants of the legendary Bee Collective. Blessed by the Queen God Aiola and her unhatched children (the 3 moons). They are secluded on top of the giant tree mountains, and usually avoid harm's way. Due to the diverse ecosystem on the trees, the ant colonies are rarely able to reach the Silken Cities of the Moths. 
Legend tells of 4 tribal matriarchs uniting and forming the Cocoon Collective thousands of years ago. Their innate flying ability allowed them to focus on their own culture and needs. While distant, conflict is not unknown to them - they have fought for territory and resources as any other Collective, but have since opted for diplomacy where feasible. They believe that Ranged combat is as barbaric as the Fire ants and their poison spitting - if Moths are to fight, they believe that the warrior should see and feel the enemy, as they slay or are slain. Initiating a fight without honor is a sure way to be shunned in society. 
They are also a  very religious and mystical society - they worship the [[aiola_diety|Sun Goddess Aiola]], and believe to be the chosen race of Ryyun. 
One of the only societies on the planet to successfully reach space (due to their proximity to the heavens), and fascination with Aiola. Butterflies and some Dragonfly nomads are said to also have explored spaced. The former, gave up quickly due to their narcissism and hedonism (Butterflies are often the butt of Moth jokes). While the latter lack any societal structure to support such extreme adventures.
While in their history, 4 tribes and 4 matriarchs ruled over their vast Heavenly Kingdom, for the past couple of millennia the Collective has been ruled by an absolute Matriarch Queen. She is chosen after the death of the previous ruler, by a council of mystics, scientists, feudal lords and worker organizers. The criteria used is the Queen's life work up until this choice. 
There are different "roles" into which a Moth can be born into. Given their metamorphosis stages, consciousness isn't always a given. No one Moth remembers its previous Larva incarnation, but it is undeniable that their body came to be from it. And scientists have proven that during the Larva stage, the future Moth's talents and gifts can be observed - for example, a Moth which would grow specialize in the Arts of practical weaving (tools, objects, weapons), can be seen to spin itself cocoons of incredibly specific and geometric patterns as a Larva; another, which would rather be an engineering weaver(infrastructure, buildings, machinery), warrior moth have a longer larvae stage of development, the most "promising" of which spend their first life crafting the weapon of their choice; mystical Moths' larvae sometimes do not produce Silk cocoons at all, and have to be assisted by another Larva or Moth, in order to proceed. This lack of Silk production carries on in their next incarnation. 
The 4 initial Tribes' wing patterns can still be seen today, however at this point the gene-pool has merged, and all kinds of variations between upper and lower wing combinations can be seen. 
There are several specific archetypes of Moth, when the pattern of wing couples match:
-- Mystics (1) - religious and spiritual - not quite adept at silk spinning - could be scientific, rather than mystical. -
-- Guardians (2) - warriors built combat - strongest and most resilient of Moths - okay Silk weaving skills - Royal Guardians and soldiers
-- Scouts (3) - fastest and most agile of Moths - usually scouts in war, "astronauts", athletes - Silk weaving skills are quite advanced
-- Carriers (4) - heavy lifters and marathon fliers - wing structure allows for effortless gliding - Silk weaving skills are quite advanced
However, with  the various combinations, individuals get to discover their talents and lack of such throughout their life. Some Moths are ridiculed for their "non-optimal" heritage. Due to the variety, it's hard to classify them.
There is another type of Moth, and it is the Queen Moth. They are wingless Moths, who are often 2-3x size of other Moths. They hatch and care for eggs, and have powerful sonar systems to communicate commands and news to Moths far away. Due to their lack of flight, any Queen has her entourage of caretakers and supporters, but without them, they cannot last for long. But if cared for, Queen Moths can live and rule for hundreds of years.

Two decades ago, the previous Matriarch died of natural causes (Queen Poia, aged 543), and there has been a swift shift in the socium's priorities and desires. Due to the Queen Matriarch ability to influence once crowned, most citizen gladly follow orders and adapt to the Collective's overall goals. The current leader is the 120 year old Yoola. She is a vivid supporter of religion, and in recent there have been a  lot of governmental shifts towards theocracy. This also coincides with the project "Ascension".

Due to the previous Ruler's focus on technology and sciences, great advances have been made. The Moths started dreaming of the stars, moons and planets, and began to dare to explore. With many failed experiments, a breakthrough was had, and the first Moth reached outer space a bit more than 300 years ago. It was found that the Moths' thick exoskeleton allows them to survive the vacuum of space, however heat regulation and oxygen intake solutions had to be invented. With an oxygen mask, covering and shielding their eyes, trunk and mouth; the tanks of oxygen are stored on in Silk tanks on their abdomen. Using pollen (their currency), they can capture more of the Sun's light and heat, however, it as quickly found out that single flight Moths won't make it too far in space, both in speed and survival. Great ships for colonization of the far planets of their system are currently designed and tested, but there is still time before they come to work properly. For now, the most secure way of transpiration (to a Moon or planet) is by "flying" in a swarm. Essentially, hundreds of Moths form a plane, and collectively gather as much Solar Wind and heat as they can, their proximity additionally allows for preserving heat. 

The universal Moth currency is pollen - a lot of Moths who "can't seem to find their way in life" opt for the simple, yet harsh life of a pollen worker. The vast fields of flower gardens, cultivated on the top of the giant trees, need to be cared for. And so, by working, they gather food and money for their local populace. Pollen can be turned to nutrition, adhesives, coin, and various other appliances. They brew beverages of Nectar, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, but can also drink water to replenish thirst.

While, the Moths themselves have not mastered interstellar ship travel, they are known within the galaxy, and provide for a big portion of the Silk production. Given it's amazing and various properties (different Moths can spin different types of silk), it's uses in construction, fashion or any other type of crafts is too valuable. After all, their whole society is built using Silk variations. 
They have built and interstellar port, which welcomes visiting merchants and diplomats, even going so far as to sent Moth missionaries to study and explore the distant reaches of the galaxy. Or at least, this type of behavior used to be prevalent, before the Matriarchal change. The new Queen, as mentioned, is undertaking the "Ascension" project. A mad scientist's dream of absurdly massive proportions:
	There is a prophecy spoken to the Queen by the blind High Priestess Enru. She claims to be touched by Aiola herself - due to religious ceremony, her retinas were burned beyond repair by their sun. It is said that this increases the connection  to Aiola, as it allows for here energy to be felt, and used as guidance, rather than seen and blinded by. After 313 years, the planets will align perfectly, and so will their moons be positioned, so as to represent an ideal Moth constellation. It is believed that the Goddess of Light herself, will be brought back into flesh again, and that it is the Moths' mission to aid and serve her. The Moths are to make her cocoon, so that when the alignment occurs, her transformation may begin.
This story captivated the Queen, and immediately relocation of resources began. The massive project had to be started as soon as possible, and nothing else matters. The primitive wars of territory and resources are simple distraction, and irrelevant to the Moths' newly determined purpose. The plan of the project is to begin construction of planetary, lunar and solar cocoons. Giant hexagonal bridges, floating in the atmosphere (or regional equivalent), so as to make a grid between worlds. Once the initial framework is completed, the holes will be filled with Sheets of Silk, to trap the Solar energy within the cocoon. The connections between objects will allow for an "extension" of the prophesied (and subsequently confirmed by astronomers) alignment. The cocoon will radically "terraform" the whole system, which the avid followers of Aiola see not as any issue to be concerned with. There have been those, who have questioned the idea, but were quickly exiled or silenced. The idea seems so beautiful, poetic and existentially truthful to the Moth people, that fanaticism grows and grows within the Collective.
For the most part, external pressure from the galaxy hasn't been an issue for the Collective, as the need for Silk is more important than arguing with religious fanatics.
