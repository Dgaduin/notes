# Kostawa Trade Family
The family is part of the the [[tzk_syndicate|Tz'k Trade Syndicate]], mostly focused on trade with artifacts, rare technology and navigational maps. 

They have a serious presence in the [[trade_bureaus|Trade bureau]] of the family, due to the sensitive nature of their cargo.

One of the few members of the syndicate allowed to trade with [[aiola_system|Aiola System]].
