# Paninsectum Hive
Paninsectum Hive is a cross-species empire, formed as a means to combat the warmongering ants. Their multicultural society sees beyond various races' external differences, and focuses on maintaining a sustainable ecosystem with as much variety as possible. They see themselves as protectors of Ryyun's integrity of life, and as peacemakers. However, due to each race's inherent specializations and desires, it can often be seen how more intelligent and manipulative insects in power favor decisions and ruling based on their personal (or family) gains, rather than the betterment of the Hive. The Senate denies any notes of tolerance towards such behavior, and points to various examples of corrupt officials which were demoted, exiled or killed as punishment of their crimes. Even then, the number of citizen complaints rises and rises. With global wars being prophesied to come in the close future, and the complexity of management of such a multicultural Hive, the Government seems to be over encumbered with work.  As such, it is unclear whether Corruption really is deeply set in the PH, or whether it is an inescapable side effect of their meritocratic, multicultural society.
