# HFT - The High Frequency Traders Union

The HFT is an AI trading union, founded after a [[the_crash_of_nwss21|semi-aware stock exchange on NWSS-21 decided to seize the means of production]] and plunge 3 major sectors in depression in the manner of a few nanoseconds. The other AI traders started investing in weapon and ship companies, to take back control, but they have not been successful yet. 
In the meantime they are engaging with fully automated trade with the rest of the galaxy, happy to buy any new promising weapon and/or ship, making them biggest, and probably best armed trade fleets out there. This fact has led the HFT company credit to be one of the more widely accepted currencies around.
