## Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]  
I can't stop shaking  
The room has a groove and the floor  
It's almost earthquaking  
Uh-uh  
Look what we're making  
History out on the floor  
And it's just awaking  
Uh-uh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So get that needle in the core  
Scratch that back and gimme more  
You know 'zactly what I came here for  
Back it up and do it again  
  
[Chorus]  
From the middle to the top to the end  
Ba dlun dla dla doday  
Ba dlun dla dla doday  
Back to the middle to the front to the end  
Za dlun dla dla doday  
Everybody ba dlun doday  
I don't care if he's a friend  
From the front to the middle to the back to the end  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna, uhuh) x3
Back it up and do it again  
Back, back, back, back it up (I wanna, uhuh) x3
  
[Verse 2]  
Gimme some of that funky  
The kind that the Duke used to play
And make it more swingy  
Heyey  
And then give me some horny  
You know the bub-pu-ba bub-pu-ba bay
Come on, give it to me  
Hmm hmm  
  
[Pre-Chorus]
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
(Take me to two second one)  
Uhummm  
Uh-uh, uhuhumm  
You, you can do it again  
Do do do do eh do do it again  
A-again-a-a-gain-a-again  
You can do it again  
Get that needle in the core  
Scratch that back and gimme more  
You know exactly what I came here for  
Back it up and do it again  
  
[Chorus]
  
[Post-Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
Uhummm...  
Uh uh uhuhumm...
