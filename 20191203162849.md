# Add ASP controllers to DI service collection

#pin

Luckily, there's a way around this. You can change the controller activator so that controllers are added to the DI container by using the AddControllersAsServices() method on IMvcBuilder:
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers()
        .AddControllersAsServices(); // Add the controllers to DI
// services.AddSingleton<WeatherForecastService>();
    services.AddSingleton<DataService>();
}
This enables the ServiceBasedControllerActivator (see my previous post for a detailed explanation) and registers the controllers in the DI container as services. If we run the app now, the validation detects the missing controller dependency on app startup, and throws an exception:
