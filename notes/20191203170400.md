This reminds me of Brian Balfour's "Four Fits" model which is the bedrock for how I think about companies.
You need four things: (1) a market, i.e. a set of customers with a valuable problem; (2) a product that actually solves that problem well; (3) a channel through which you can reach these customers; and (4) a business model to sustain the above efforts.
