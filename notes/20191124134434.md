# htm

#js #frontend

`htm` is a render wrapper to allow for client-side JSX-like templating.

It needs to be passed a supported render function, e.g. React's `render` or Preact's `h`, `const html = htm.bind(h);`

Supports:

* Props spread like `<article id="main" ...${internalProps}></article>`
* Self closing tags `<component />`
* Closing components with `<//>`

[[20191124143845]] Good integration with Preact, including prebuilt module with both included
