# Servor

Servor is dependency free local http server with file watcher

Add servor as a dev dependency using `npm i servor -D` or run directly from the terminal:

`npx servor <directory> <fallback> <port> <reloadPort>`

* `<directory>` path to serve static files from (defaults to current directory `.`)
* `<fallback>` the file served for all non-file requests (defaults to `index.html`)
* `<port>` what port you want to serve the files from (defaults to `8080`)
* `<reloadPort>` what port you want the reload script to listen on (defaults to `5000`)

There are also optional flags you can pass as arguments:

* `--no-browser`prevents the browser from opening when the server starts
* `--no-reload` prevents the browser from reloading when files change
