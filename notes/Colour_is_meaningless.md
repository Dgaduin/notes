# Colour is meaningless[^1]

The only things you can communicate with colour are:

* **Any colour:** this thing has a colour.
* **A different colour:** this thing is not the same as the other thing.
* **Gray:** this thing is broken.
* **Red:** the designer hates you and wants to make you angry.

> Colour is not verbal or rational. It’s contextual and emotional. It’s powerful, not meaningful.
