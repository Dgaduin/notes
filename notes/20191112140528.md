# Content has purpose, around which design has to happen

Things have names, and need to be verbed. Defining the names and the verbs is the most important part of UX.
When you fail to grapple directly with the actual content, but focus on designing boxes for whatever the content will be, what you’re actually doing is putting pretty boxes between the user and their goals. Stop it. Design the content, and you’ll probably be just about done.
