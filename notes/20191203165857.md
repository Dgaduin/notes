The 10:1 rule of writing and programming
Give that my data set is limited, I can only draw a few preliminary conclusions:
	1. The ratio of “raw materials” to “finished product” in a book is roughly 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time an editor asks you for a timeline! If you want to write a 300 page book, you’ll probably have to write around 3,000 pages.
	2. Similarly, the ratio of “code churn” to “lines of code” in mature and non-trivial software is also at least 10:1. Keep this in mind the next time a manager or customer asks you for a time estimate! To build a 10,000 line app, expect to write roughly 100,000 lines.
These can be summarized as what I shall dub the 10:1 rule of writing and programming:
Good software and good writing requires that every line has been rewritten, on average, at least 10 times.
