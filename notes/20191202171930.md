`DebuggerDisplay` - Attribute to decorate how to format specific values in debug windows like Watch, Locals and Autos

[Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-the-debuggerdisplay-attribute?view=vs-2019)

[DebuggerDisplay("Name: {FullName,nq}")]
[DebuggerBrowsable(DebuggerBrowsableState.Never)] 

The DebuggerDisplayAttribute has an optional parameter for TargetType. This can be used in conjunction with setting the DebuggerDisplayAttribute at the assembly level, to customize types even when you cannot modify their source.

Visual Studio ships with a file called autoexp.cs & autoexp.dll (auto expand) in <visual studio install location>\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers\Original. This file already has several DebuggerDisplay attributes that customize common framework types. We can modify it from an elevated command prompt and add the following:
[assembly: DebuggerDisplay("Host: {HostName}", Target = typeof(IPHostEntry))]
1
	
[assembly: DebuggerDisplay("Host: {HostName}", Target = typeof(IPHostEntry))]

We then compile it, again from an elevated developer command prompt, with the command line “csc /t:library autoexp.cs”. The next time we debug our program, we’ll now see:

Applying view customizations to framework types - Debugger Display

This allows for powerful, time-saving, customizations of your own types, frameworks you ship to others, and any code on which you depend.
