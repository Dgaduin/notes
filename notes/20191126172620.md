# Phantom Test 

Test which returns correctly, but not because the code under test is doing the right thing or anything at all.

## Maxim 1:

A test checking that nothing happened must be accompanied by a test checking that something happened

## Maxim 2:

A phantom test proves nothing if it passes.
It indicates a real problem if it fails.

## Maxim 3:

How you arrive at a phantom test matters.

## Maxim 4:

Whenever possible convert phantom tests to real tests.
