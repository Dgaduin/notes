# Linux terminal symbols

* `Ctrl+i, Ctrl+Shift+i, Tab`
* `Ctrl+j, Ctrl+Shift+j, Enter`
* `Ctrl+[, Ctrl+Shift+[, Escape`
* `Ctrl+d, Ctrl+Shift+d, EOF`
* `Ctrl+g, Ctrl+Shift+g, BEL`

Key points:

* `When you rebind any one of those triples, you rebind all of them`
* `You cannot have separate keybindings for any two or three members of a triple`
* `Ctrl+char and Ctrl+Shift+char are not distinct.`
