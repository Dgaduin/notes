* 1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt

1. In a food processor bowl or blender jar, or using a tall and narrow vessel suitable for an immersion blender, combine feta, yogurt, and garlic, then blend or process until very smooth, scraping down sides as necessary. Add olive oil and blend until incorporated.
2. If desired, pass spread through a fine-mesh strainer for an even silkier texture.

## Make-Ahead and Storage

Dill, mint, or oregano can be added during or after blending.
