Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time" by Dava Sobel.

Mediam viam elige. (Choose the middle way.)

Ex minima magnus scintilla nascitur ignis.
A fire can be born from a little spark.

Alis volat propriis.
She flies with her own wings.

Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi sed saepe cadendo.
A water drop hollows a stone, not by force, but by falling often.

Per tenebras lucem quaero. 
Through darkness, I seek the light.

Semper ad meliora. 
It always gets better.

Credo quia absurdum est. 
I believe it because it’s absurd.

Fallaces sunt rerum species. 
The appearances of things are deceptive.

Mutantur omnia nos et mutamur in illis. 
All things change, and we change with them.

Audendo magnus tegitur timor. 
By audacity, great fears are concealed.

Altissima quaeque flumina minimo sono labi.
Stillest waters run the deepest. (Quiet people are often very thoughtful.)

Aut viam inveniam aut faciam. 
I’ll either find a way or make one.

It’s a brain.  With tentacles.  Whose party trick is dominating you into doing evil acts, then wiping your memory after.  Fun!

While many oozes are a gross but explicable part of the natural ecosystem—essentially slime molds with attitude—brain oozes are clearly the result of something else: a curse gone wrong, experiments by aberrations, creatures from another world…who knows?  Interestingly, “they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies,” according to the Bestiary 3.  A hunger for spellcasters is a given when it comes to mind-hungry monsters, but a taste for fey and outsiders is intriguing, as these beings usually stand outside the usual food chains.  That brain oozes prize these mystical/metaphysical intelligences supports the theory of some otherworldly (or even otherdimensionally) aberrant or scientific origin for these strange sensation-predators…

A brain ooze takes up residence under the stairs of an inn, having crawled up from the Lands Below via the sump in the ale cellar.  It is thoroughly enjoying gorging itself on so many new vulnerable minds.  Despite its intelligence, though, it does not fully comprehend human society, so while it has been careful never to dominate the same victim twice, it does not realize that a succession of bloody crimes that all point back to the same inn will raise authorities’ suspicions.

A brain ooze preys on sprites in Curvale Forest.  The little fey are up in arms, and they blame the folk of nearby Curvale Parish, whose wizard used to steal sprites to power his faerie lamps.  The wizard is now dead and the parishioners are blameless, but to convince the fey they need adventurers to search his tower and the forest for the real culprit.

A product of a malfunctioning life support system (that was apparently more can opener than hibernation chamber), brain oozes are all that remain of the crew complement of a crashed alien vessel.  Of the flight of five that inhabit the hulk, only one is still committed to returning to its original body and repairing the ship.  The others have become utterly distracted by their new powers, as well as more than a little cruel.  Their only ambition is compelling intelligence-damaged thralls to fight to the death in the ship’s mess.

Back from my 25 hours in Boston!  (Yesterday’s post was written sitting on the floor of Logan.) 

Back when it was a thing, I used to listen to the podcast Webcomics Weekly, and more than once they talked about the magic of 1,000 readers—that when you got to 1,000 readers on the Web things just seemed to snowball.  That may explain why it took me well over two years to reach 1,000 Tumblr followers…and yet you all have boosted that number by 20% in the last 7 weeks alone.  Thanks for joining (and liking and reblogging), guys!


You took that pretty well. Then again, you’ve read the Economic Necronomicon. Nothing i say can weird you out.

“The Lore is happening in real-time.” - our DM

“Breakfast is the only meal of the day that I tend to view with the same kind of traditionalized reverence that most people associate with Lunch and Dinner. I like to eat breakfast alone, and almost never before noon; anybody with a terminally jangled lifestyle needs at least one psychic anchor every twenty-four hours, and mine is breakfast. In Hong Kong, Dallas or at home — and regardless of whether or not I have been to bed — breakfast is a personal ritual that can only be properly observed alone, and in a spirit of genuine excess. The food factor should always be massive: four Bloody Marys, two grapefruits, a pot of coffee, Rangoon crepes, a half-pound of either sausage, bacon, or corned beef hash with diced chiles, a Spanish omelette or eggs Benedict, a quart of milk, a chopped lemon for random seasoning, and something like a slice of Key lime pie, two margaritas, and six lines of the best cocaine for dessert… Right, and there should also be two or three newspapers, all mail and messages, a telephone, a notebook for planning the next twenty-four hours and at least one source of good music… All of which should be dealt with outside, in the warmth of a hot sun, and preferably stone naked.”

Odd -- JavaCard smartcards are available for under $5, have crypto co-processors, and certainly support general-purpose code. See for example my project for KeePass, http://code.lardcave.net/2016/08/06/1/ . After programming, you can choose to lock down the card (which means you can only erase the card, not modify it). I'm using NXP chips and although I haven't investigated completely I would be highly surprised if it was not possible to get the tamper-resistant and cryptographic properties the author is after.
There is an open-source toolchain for generating code for the card which works great from OS X or Linux. Contactless writers are available on eBay for like twenty bucks. And they will even work (via NFC) with Android phones.
It's a great time to be playing with contactless general-purpose smartcards.


types of road

as much as i appreciate it, I've been given gold 5 times in this thread, I dont need it more, if you appreciated it that much, I would much rather you make a donation to your local food bank or toys for tots drive and let me know about it in the comments, there are a lot of people going hungry and giftless and your money is better spent on them than me
As this has gotten so popular I want to emphasize from the start, there are many acceptable definitions for these, this is just one set, it is highly likely you have seen something different. Different places will have different rules on whats what or no rules at all. There are literally dozens of right answers to this. Almost all of these should really be affixed with "is usually" but because of how long this has gotten, I cant include every exception and variation.
this post has become more effort than its worth and I am no longer maintaining it or replying to it, thanks for understanding
everything I found here is either rephrased from an urban planning textbook, wikipedia, or googles define function, I never claimed to be an expert on anything, what I gave here is essentially the most common occuring definition I could find, but many are used interchangeably, how a word is used in vernacular does not change an accepted definition.
• A road has no special qualifiers. It connects point a to point b.
• A street connects buildings together, usually in a city, usually east to west, opposite of avenue.
• An avenue runs north south. Avenues and streets may be used interchangeably for directions, usually has median
• A boulevard is a street with trees down the middle or on both sides
• A lane is a narrow street usually lacking a median.
• A drive is a private, winding road
• A way is a small out of the way road
• a court usually ends in a cul de sac or similar little loop
• a plaza or square is usually a wide open space, but in modern definitons, one of the above probably fits better for a plaza as a road.
• a terrace is a raised flat area around a building. When used for a road it probably better fits one of the above.
• uk, a close is similar to a court, a short road serving a few houses, may have cul de sac
• run is usually located near a stream or other small body of water
• place is similar to a court, or close, usually a short skinny dead end road, with or without cul de sac, sometimes p shaped
• bay is a small road where both ends link to the same connecting road
• crescent is a windy s like shape, or just a crescent shape, for the record, above definition of bay was also given to me for crescent
• a trail is usually in or near a wooded area
• mews is an old british way of saying row of stables, more modernly seperate houses surrounding a courtyard
• a highway is a major public road, usually connecting multiple cities
• a motorway is similar to a highway, with the term more common in New Zealand, the UK, and Austrailia, no stopping, no pedestrian or animal traffic allowed
• an interstate is a highway system connecting usually connecting multiple states, although some exist with no connections
• a turnpike is part of a highway, and usully has a toll, often located close to a city or commercial are
• a freeway is part of a highway with 2 or more lanes on each side, no tolls, sometimes termed expressway, no intersections or cross streets.
• a parkway is a major public road, usually decorated, sometimes part of a highway, has traffic lights.
• a causeway combines roads and bridges, usually to cross a body of water
• circuit and speedway are used interchangeably, usually refers to a racing course, practically probably something above.
• as the name implies, garden is usually a well decorated small road, but probably better fits an above
• a view is usually on a raised area of land, a hill or something similar.
• byway is a minor road, usually a bit out of the way and not following main roads.
• a cove is a narrow road, can be sheltered, usually near a larger body of water or mountains
• a row is a street with a continuous line of close together houses on one or both sides, usually serving a specific function like a frat
• a beltway is a highway surrounding an urban area
• quay is a concrete platform running along water
• crossing is where two roads meet
• alley a narrow path or road between buildings, sometimes connects streets, not always driveable
• point usually dead ends at a hill
• pike usually a toll road
• esplanade long open, level area, usually a walking path near the ocean
• square open area where multiple streets meet, guess how its usually shaped.
• landing usually near a dock or port, historically where boats drop goods.
• walk historically a walking path or sidewalk, probably became a road later in its history
• grove thickly sheltered by trees
• copse a small grove
• driveway almost always private, short, leading to a single residence or a few related ones
• laneway uncommon, usually down a country road, itself a public road leading to multiple private driveways.
• trace beaten path
• circle usually circles around an area, but sometimes is like a "square", an open place intersected by multiple roads.
• channel usually near a water channel, the water itself connecting two larger bodies of water,
• grange historically would have been a farmhouse or collection of houses on a farm, the road probably runs through what used to be a farm
• park originally meaning an enclosed space, came to refer to an enclosed area of nature in a city, usually a well decorated road.
• mill probably near an old flour mill or other mill.
• spur similar to a byway, a smaller road branching off from a major road.
• bypass passes around a populated area to divert traffic
• roundabout or traffic circle circle around a traffic island with multiple connecting routes, a roundabout is usually smaller, with less room for crossing and passing, and safer
• wynd a narrow lane between houses, similar to an alley, more common in UK
• drive shortened form of driveway, not a driveway itself, usually in a neighborhood, connects several houses
• parade wider than average road historically used as a parade ground.
• terrace more common in uk, a row of houses.
• chase on land historically used as private hunting grounds.
• branch divides a road or area into multiple subdivisions.
These arent hard and fast rules. Most cities and such redefine them their own way about what road can be called what.
why you drive on a parkway and park on a driveway parkway originally referred to the decorations along that particular road, not the state of the cars on it, its similarities to a park being obvious. driveways were orignally much longer than they are now, so you actually would drive on them.

And I learned that Wyoming is big and scary. I learned that Nebraska is a sleepy state with not much to see except sunrises over endless fields of corn. I learned that, in the right light, Iowa can look like a Cézanne painting. I learned that Iowa City is a little haven in the middle of an otherwise forgettable state. I learned that if you look up at the night sky in the middle of Illinois, you can see the Milky Way. I learned that Pilots and Flying J's offer free wi-fi. I learned that Michigan looks a lot like Upstate New York. I learned that Pittsburgh is a beautiful city. I learned that the center of Pennsylvania can be sketchy at night.
