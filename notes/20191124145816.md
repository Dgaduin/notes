# Preact Router

A simple URL-based router for Preact. The baseline is a simple import `import Router from 'preact-router';`

Usage:

```JSX
const Main = () => (
    <Router>
        <Home path="/" />
        <About path="/about" />
        <Search path="/search/:query/:advanced?" />
    </Router>
    );
```

Query parameters marked with `:` are added as props to the component.

There is an option for lazy loading with `AsyncRoute`.

It supports hash history using:

```JSX
import { createHashHistory } from 'history';

const Main = () => (
    <Router history={createHashHistory()}>
    );
```

This gives us `url/#path` styled links, which helps with cases, where the browser would navigate to a resource, instead of leaving the handling to us.
