Aggregate Root
One place I do often use a repository is when accessing an aggregate (in DDD Terms). My repositories often only contain two methods, Get(id) and Save(aggregateRoot).
The reason I do use a repository in this situation is that my repository usually returns an object that encapsulates my EF data model. I want it to fetch the entire object model and construct the aggregate root. The aggregate root does not expose data but only behavior (methods) to change state.
