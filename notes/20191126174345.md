# Convention based build scripts

#repo-management

Root folder which has a list of scripts to perform different actions:

* Setup dependencies 
* Fetch remote resources 
* Start local server
* Generate container image 
* Create a build
* Run tests

> I love how simple it can be to tell anyone to clone the project and run these steps:

```bash
cd path/to/project
./bin/setup
./bin/start
```
