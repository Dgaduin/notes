# Holistic Notes

Information is always related, even if the connection is 2nd or 3rd hand. 
Segregation of knowledge starts becoming an issue when possible related information lies outside of the domain constraints (be it medium, system or type). 
Information should be kept as a whole and allowed to grow organically, establishing relations as they appear or become obvious.
