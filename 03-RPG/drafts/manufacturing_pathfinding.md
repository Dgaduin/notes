I read this was a manufacturing pathfinder.

Manufacturing and assembly of high strength hardened steel is near black art.

Pathfinders do exactly what they say, they lead you through unknown territory to the outcome of the manufacturing journey you embarked on. Often things go boom, you find out why, add it to your corpus of black art knowledge, and keep pathfinding until you run out of budget / succeed / change mission.

So as manufacturing pathfinder, this is what success often looks like.
