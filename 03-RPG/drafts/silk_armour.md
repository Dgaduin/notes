# Silk Armour

#rpg/idea/item #self/todo/to-expand

This sounds ridiculous at first, but the Mongol horde used silk armors which were much more penetration-protective than European plate armor. Above the thick silk armour they've worn a scale armour to protect them from cutting damage. The silk armour was super effective as it was very light an hardly penetratable by spears and arrows alike. Silkworm silk has a density of about 1.3 and an MPa rating of 500.
