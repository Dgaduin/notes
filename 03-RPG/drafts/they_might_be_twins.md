# They Might Be Twins

#rpg/idea/power

I once pit my party against a pair of twins who were actually a single bi-locating person, but because they'd bi-located while still fetal, neither knew which one was the "real" one. Practically, they were able to communicate telepathically, share perceptions, teleport to each other's locations and switch places. Not the flashiest power, but the use of motor transport, grappling hooks and other technologies made it very effective. It also meant that one could jump off a building and teleport to her sister just in time to land a 30-story drop kick on whoever she was fighting.
