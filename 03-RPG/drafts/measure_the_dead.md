# Measure the Dead

#rpg/idea/culture/ritual

As part of the prayers and invocation of the saint, Lady Mary sent one of her handmaidens to the house of Thomas Mathews to measure the body (or the length of all the wounds on it) of William Cragh with a piece of string. This was a religious practice common in medieval England, whereby a body would be measured lengthwise with a piece of thread, the thread or string would then be dipped into wax to make a taper the same length of the person in need of the saintly help, in hopes of attracting their attention to the request. They also bent a penny in Thomas de Cantilupes name, another religious practice in the invocation of saints where the invoker would quite literally, bend the soft silver of a penny.

After all the invocations and pleading to Thomas de Cantilupe, the body of William Cragh lay lifeless and still on the floor of the Swansea household. To all onlookers, he was as dead in the evening as he was when he was pulled from the gallows and transported to town. At least, that was until around the middle of the night.

“After he had been measured, not immediately but after an hour or so, William Cragh moved his tongue a little and after another space fo time moved a foot and afterwards gradually began to recover strength in his limbs.”
