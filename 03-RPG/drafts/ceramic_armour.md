# Ceramic Armour Plates

#rpg/idea/item #self/todo/to-expand

You could use ceramic plates in vests to get a high penetration-protective armor. Ceramic is used in a lot of modern composite armors and bullet proof vests. Ceramic armor is however a one-use armor as the ceramic tends to shatter after receiving a blow or two. As ceramic is much lighter than steel or iron, ceramic vest seems to be useful to skirmishers - fast attack, fast withdraw, minimal casualties.
