# Forgettable Appearance

#rpg/idea/power #self/todo/pin

Played a game where someone had a psychically forgettable presence. After being observed for a few seconds, people would forget their interactions with the person in question. At later levels he could make himself functionally invisible to being recorded by cameras or other optics.
