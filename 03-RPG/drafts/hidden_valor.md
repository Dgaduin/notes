# Hidden Valor

#rpg/idea/item

A sentient quill, refilling ink well, and multiplying parchment stack set, that follows around the bravest and most heroic (or the most heinous and corrupt) group that it can find, recording the deeds (or misdeeds) of their adventures and exploits. The group may find the books in stores filed under fiction, and try as they might, they are unable to claim recognition for their actions, at least, from anyone who’s read the book.
