# The Red Queen Syndrome

#rpg/idea/power #self/todo/pin

Headtaker. When he strikes people, it's off with their heads. Then he stuffs them in a bag and takes both pieces to the police station. He doesn't "actually" disconnect the two body parts due to reasons, and the criminal can still breathe, has no bloodflow problems, etc, but the head still falls off and rolls around very disorientingly until you can stick it back on your neck, at which point it will stay put.
