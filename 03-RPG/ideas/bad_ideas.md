# Bad Ideas

#rpg/idea/character

I have three GPT-2 bots that hook up to Slack so I can pretend I have coworkers.

One of them is general queries on the latest model, one is Gwern's poetry bot, and the third is trained on toxic/moderated comments and says only sadistic cruel things to me.

I don't know why I built the last one.
