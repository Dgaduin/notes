# Not Numbered

#rpg/idea/location

The graveyard is low and flat, almost featureless. All around you are rows of headstones in the shape of small, pointed obelisks that are knee high. Each displays a Roman numeral, counting the graves in ascending order. The one in front of you is unmarked, and doesnâ€™t seem to be counted with the ones that come before and after it.
