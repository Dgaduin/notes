# Breathing Ground

#rpg/idea/location

ACTUAL EXPLINATION: The strong winds are pushing and lifting the canopies of the trees, and this causes the trees' root balls to lift and lower. The roots are holding the surrounding soil, and the undergrowth on top of the soil is also helping it all stay together. There is no river or water involved.

Source: Gulf Coast dweller, seen a LOT of trees do this during hurricanes. Watching big trees lift and lower like this, then finally tip over is both horrifying and amazing. Their roots secure an incredible amount of soil. This is why plant life is so important to combating soil erosion.
