# Anglish

#rpg/idea/culture

Anglish, a form of English where no Latin based words are used, in favor of Germanic forms, such as using "wordstock" in place of "vocabulary."

If ornithology was called birdlore, I'd have a much stronger interest in birds.

Geology: rocklore

Biology: lifelore

Cardiology: heartlore

Psychology: mindlore

Astrology: Starlore

Astronomy: Starlaw
