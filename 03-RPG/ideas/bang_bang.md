# Bang-bang

#rpg/idea/power

I always like the idea of playing a character that could immediately cause an explosion comparable to that of a hand grenade by pointing at something (or someone) with a fingergun and yelling 'bang' at the top of their lungs. The ability would function six times, but would need to be 'reloaded' afterwards.

The reload requires to purchase special bullets, which are consumed like pills.
