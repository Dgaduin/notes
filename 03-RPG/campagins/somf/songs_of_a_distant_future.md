### Prompt

The world is dying - the prophecies of the second sun are revealing the doomed fate of the world. Far, at the end of all roads, from the city of Eridu erupts a call of power, heard by the desperate, powerful and greedy.

The Lost Company is marching on, their uniforms ragged like their flesh, littering the western road.

The Church of Al’Azir is drowning the streets of Eridu in blood, filling their barrels and praying for salvation, that won’t come.

The Orphans arrive through the shadows, the servants of the Jester King, like rat, locust and plague, are ever present, ever hungry.

A group of scavengers and vandals is standing in front of the southern gate of the First City, feeling the pull of desperation from the burning heart.

The second sun approaches, the end is nigh.
