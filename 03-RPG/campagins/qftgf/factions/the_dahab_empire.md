# Dahab Empire

The Dahab empire is a multi-sector spanning monarchy and home to the [[../species/dahab_species|Dahab species]].

They have been around since forever and have been at the bottom of almost every big conflict around, due to the longevity of it's people and their tendency to have to recycle memory space.

They have a highly structured cast system.

The empire is probably the only stand alone fleet that can match the [[the_high_frequency_traders_union|HFS]] in terms of numbers and guns.

They tend to favor gold and teal as their colors, and consider non-energy based guns to be barbaric. Maybe because their shields don't work that well against other types of weapons.

Aspect: We were once there
