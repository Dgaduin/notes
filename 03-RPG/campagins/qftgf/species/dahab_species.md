# Dahab

Tall gender-less humanoids, with bald heads and slightly pointed years.

Their skin and bones are slightly transparent, but quite flexible, due to some minerals in their diet.

They live annoyingly long time, due to a recycling organ, which can produce regenerative cells, but they also have an issue with retaining all memories of their life, which means they have memories of only the last 2-3 hundred years. Some of higher casts can have their older memories digitalized and the very rich have a needle-cast backup, storing every moment.

They tend to be slightly phonic, but usually limited to non-verbal communication and enhanced empathy.

Aspect: Always new
