# Voh

The Voh are 12 feet tall, predominantly female, cannibalistic, bear-like humanoids. They live in a strict, cast-based, matriarchal society, focused on honor and preserving order. They value money and science, rarely war, currently. They used to make some of the best war ships, but have embraced more peaceful methods in the last 2 millennia. Males tend to be around 7-9 feet, and very subservient, and are forbidden from holding posts above a certain position.
