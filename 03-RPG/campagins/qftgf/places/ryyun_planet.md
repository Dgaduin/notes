# Ryyun

Planet of Ryyun, in the Aiola solar system (named for the Aiola star in it). Giant terrestrial planet, with high amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere, which resulted in giant vegetation, fungi and arthropods which became the dominant force on the planet.

With time different cultures started to form. Though in the battle for resources and territory only the most well equipped races could survive, and control the primitive forms of life for gains.

Ants, Termites and other hive terran insects built empires across the globe in their respective environments, dominating the landscape.

Bee societies were one of the first to flourish (gain consciousness), but have since vanished due to ancient conflicts. They are known to have advanced in culture, environmentally integrated architecture and sciences, but their lack of desire for conflict made them unprepared for the ruthless advances of the ancient Warrior Ant colonies. Multiple millennia ago, and after centuries of war, only a few bees were left to wander in exile.

Wasp tribes can still be found - a nomadic culture of mercenaries - and historical counterpart to the Bee Collective. Cross-tribe fights are not unusual to hear about. Their thirst for battle and plunder keeps the populace low and their technological advances limited. Feared by most, and avoided by all, they have won themselves an eternal place in the ecosystem - exterminators of enemies.

Spiders and scorpions are mostly regarded as mythological creatures, rather than a real thing. While there are been findings of giant spider carcasses, most residents of the planet do not believe (if they care at all) that such enormous solitary beings live today. In ancient times, they are said to have dominated the planet - extinguishing and feasting on civilizations. Each current race has a different take on what happened to them (with each at least partial credit for their dethroning), but what can be found in each version is that at some point in the past, the various social insects started organizing and fighting the giant beasts. According to a Ladybug (species enslaved by the Warrior-Fire Ant Imperial Colony, to serve as doctors and gardeners) tale, God (Aiola) granted the lesser creatures (insects) consciousness, so they could realize the might and threat of the behemoth - this is seen as the beginning of the New Age.

Ocean creatures are not well known to the surface societies, as most of them cannot survive the water environment. However, giant shells or corpses of crustaceans can be found ashore, and made into cities by sand centipedes or ants. Rumors can be heard in the [[../factions/paninsectum_hive|Paninsectum Hive]], that during cross-ocean bridge construction, the [[../factions/warrior_fire_ant_imperial_colony|Warrior-Fire Ant Imperial Colony (WAIC)]] made contact with various submarine species and are working to recruit them for ultimate planet domination.
