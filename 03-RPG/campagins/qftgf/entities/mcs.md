# MCS - Mass Catapult System

Mas Catapult has been a standard for millennia in galactic travel, by accelerating ships to super C speeds by using deep grav wells to accelerate an anchor, which will act as a counterweight to the ship.

It is not know who invented them first, but almost everyone prefers them to the alternatives. Even the oldest races have no idea where they came from, but they have been easy(relatively) to engineer.

The actual way they achieve FTL speeds is still an unsolved question. Some humans speculate they break trough some unknown limit in the universe akin to something they call "wall-clipping"?
