# The Argo

The Argo is a trade frigate with trade capacity of 12 000 tons, belonging to the [[../factions/kostawa_trade_family|Kostawa Trade Family]]. It comes equipped with 3 PDC cannons, 1 externally mounted railgun and a energy deflector shield. In addition it houses 4 interceptors and 2 low-range landing shuttles.

It was build around 400 years ago, in the [[../places/solar_sector|Solar Sector]] by humans, trying to emulate [[../species/voh|Voh]] ships and has changed hands a few times, and has been rebuilt at least 3 times, due to damage. Due to this the ship has some unintentional design choices, like 'secret' compartments, unexplained cables and having to keep Aux Engine 3 light on to be able to start an array power cycle.

The ship is red and yellow, with the name on the tip of the bow, port side, similar to old human ships. It has 3 big pulse engines at the stern and 2 smaller ones on each side of the bow. In addition there are 6 aux gas rotation engines.
