# Blocks

Like [[fate_hazzards|hazzards]], blocks have a name and a skill rating, and potentially a weapon rating, but they act as an obstacle for reaching a specific zone. They introduce an obstacle that has to be overcome in a specific circumstance, by beating the rating.

If it can cause damage use the shift difference + weapon rating if applicable.

They can be removed at skill rating +2.

You can force someone in them for half of weapon rating rounded down.

They can be used as armor for half of skill rating rounded down or completely mitigating it.
