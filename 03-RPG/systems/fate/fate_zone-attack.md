# Zone Attack

Some attacks are going to target a full zone, which consist of a single attack roll and multiple defense rolls. Ties grant no boosts and there are no exceptions in the targets.

<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opening very large documents in Preview mode will now work much better. We now only render block elements that are in view, and anything that’s outside of the visible scroll area is temporarily hidden for performance (tested on “War and Peace” at 3MB/570k words).</li>
<li>LaTeX now has full MathJax input library included, which should allow the imported libraries to work.</li>
<li>Pressing the Enter key in the search query will run the query again even if it hasn’t been changed.</li>
<li>The account tab now has a loading animation, instead of showing a “login” page before quickly flashing to the logged in version.</li></ul>
