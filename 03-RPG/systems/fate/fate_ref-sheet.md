# FATE

## Core

### Rules

#### Success and Failure

##### Fail

If your effort is less than the target difficulty or opposition, you fail.

* Simple Failure - You don't accomplish your goal and are left wanting
* Success at a major cost - Make life complicated, for the price of success
* Take a hit - suffer stress/consequence for the price of success

#### Tie

If your effort is equal to the target, you tie.

* Success at a minor cost - stress, boost, narrative hurdles
* Partial success

##### Success

If your effort is one or two shifts more than the target, you succeed.  

##### Success with Style

If your effort is three or more shifts more than the target, you succeed with style.

 * Get a boost

#### Actions

Overcome

* Fail for a boost on a tie

Create and advantage

* When creating new aspects:
	* Misapplied aspect on a fail
	* Free invoke for the enemy on a fail
	* Boost on a tie
	* One or two free invokes on success and success with style
* When using existing know or unknown aspect (discover an enemy aspect)
	* If you fail, and the aspect was known, the enemy gets a free invoke. If it was unknown, they may choose to reveal it to get a free invoke
	* If you tie, you gain a boost if the aspect was unknown; it stays unknown. If the aspect is known, you get a free invoke on it instead.
	* If you succeed, gain a free invoke on the aspect, revealing it if unknown.
	* If you succeed with style, gain two free invokes, revealing it if unknown.

Attack

* Boost on a tie
* Damage to diff on success
* Trade a shift for a boost on success with style

Defend

* Tie based of opposed action
* Boost on success with style

Teamwork

Give +1 for group checks, consumes actions, exposes to effects of fail. Max bonus, highest skill level
